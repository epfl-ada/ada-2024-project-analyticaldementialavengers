patterns from radio broadcasts of live vs. pre-recorded voices, he has determined that \"The Voice of Terror\" is actually recorded on phonograph records in England, but broadcast from Germany.', 'Using a tip from Kitty, Holmes and Watson go to the old Christopher Docks, where they are followed by Sir Anthony Lloyd  of the council.', 'The three men are captured by a group of Nazi spies led by a man named Meade , although Meade manages to escape through a trap door to a waiting speedboat.', 'Kitty pretends to be a thief on the run and joins Meade.', 'After one of Holmes informants traces Meade and Kitty to the south coast of England, Holmes forces the council to go there with him.', 'With the support of British troopers, Holmes captures Meade and a group of German soldiers stationed in an abandoned church.', 'Holmes then reveals that in World War I, the real Barham was a prisoner in a German war camp and had an uncanny resemblance to a Heinrich Von Bork, a member of the German Secret Service; one day the real Barham was taken out executed; the gentleman who called Holmes into the case was Von Bork himself who had posing as Barham for 24 years; Holmes then adds that Barham had no immediate family, so his private life was well studied by Von Bork, who also studied at Oxford and had knowledge of the English language and manners.', 'So, with a little help of plastic surgery, not to mention the resemblance to Barham in the first place, the deception was carried out thoroughly.', \":Holmes: There's an East wind coming, Watson.\", 'Looks like another warm day.',

with a Great Western express speeding out of Box Tunnel on route to Cornwall.', \"The train's passengers include Herbert and Edna, a young couple travelling to Truro to be married, Miss Bourne, a West London spinster visiting evacuated relatives, Tommy Gander, an overenthusiastic Vaudeville-style comedian and entertainer headed for the Pier Pavilion at Newquay to put on a show, Dr Sterling, a locum for a doctor in Redruth, Richard G Winthrop and his cousin Jackie, also heading for Truro, and Teddy Deakin.\", 'Just as they are passing Teignmouth, the communication cord is pulled and the train stops - only for the guard and passengers to find that Gander has lost his hat and is running back to retrieve it.', 'Ignorant of the delay this has caused, he returns to the train and comes across Jackie Winthrop in her compartment.', 'Gander tries to make conversation with her, but Teddy has his eye on Jackie and is quick to try and send him packing - at one point he insinuates that Gander is in a first class carriage with a third class ticket, whereupon Gander jokingly retorts by saying he has a platform ticket.', 'Richard has no time for either of them, so they both annoy him by pacing back and forth outside his compartment.', 'The train arrives at Fal Vale Junction, Cornwall.', 'Gander offers to share his compartment, but Teddy points out that they are travelling first class, and that Richard dislikes the comedian.', 'Instead they set about helping Miss Bourne, who initially mistakes a carriage window for a door, with her luggage, including her pet parrot, Polly.', \"Once the train has left, the passengers meet Fal Vale's stationmaster Saul Hodgkin.\", \"He tells them that the last Truro-bound train has gone, and that there won't be another until morning; he is just about to lock up for the night.\", \"Upon Richard's irate prompting, and knowing that he has to rehearse at Newquay the next morning, Gander tries to charter a special, but Saul refuses to make arrangements.\", 'As he is preparing his bicycle, rain starts to fall, and the passengers make for the station waiting room, taking out their frustrations on Gander for his lost hat.', 'Saul tries to make it clear that \"You can\\'t stay here\", but the passengers insist on staying until transport can be arranged.', 'Eventually Saul telephones for a bus, but for some reason is unable to requisition one.', 'He suggests that they walk to the local village, but the passengers object upon hearing that it is four miles away.', 'In the meantime, Gander has rescued his basket from the rain, and borrows the ticket office as a changing room.', \"In spite of the passengers' firm decision to stay put, Saul cannot bring himself to leave them alone, and neither does he wish to stay with them - his reason being that the station is haunted......\", 'In 1897, a branch line was run from Fal Vale Junction to an old port, crossing the river on a swing bridge at the other end of a tunnel close to the station.', 'The swing bridge, worked by a wheel on the platform, was kept open for china clay boats, but was closed whenever trains had to cross it.', 'One day, some locals chartered a special train to take them home, and the then stationmaster, Ted Holmes, was kept on late night duty to close the bridge for it.', 'The branch line was supposedly closed afterwards, and the bridge has always remained in the open position.', 'Ever since that day, Saul explains, there have been occasions when a train is heard desperately trying to pull up near the station.', 'With that, Saul reluctantly leaves the passengers, warning them not to look if they hear a train that night.', 'Gander has been listening in on the story too, and makes a great fuss of it; in order to take his mind off things, Richard starts a game of chess with Dr Sterling.', 'After another few moments, Miss Bourne hears something in the station buffet.', 'In order to stay dry, Gander improvises a raincoat from a tablecloth and a sheet of tarpaulin, but while obtaining his supply of water he finds the old bridge wheel.', 'Teddy and Jackie soon bring the tea through to the waiting room, and the passengers share out what little food they have to make a meal of it.', 'Gander rushes outside with his lamp and raincoat to fill a glass with water from the water crane while Richard, Teddy and Dr Sterling carry Saul into the ticket office.', 'Teddy tries to call the police, but the line appears to be down.', 'The passengers are confused, particularly when the young woman acts as if they know what she is talking about - until Teddy sees a car coming down the road.', 'As they watch, the car spins off the road and crashes into a tree, so Teddy, accompanied by Gander and Dr Sterling, go to see what has happened.', \"It turns out that he had skidded on Herbert and Edna's luggage, including a fender donated them by the owner of a furniture shop.\", 'They return to the waiting room with the battered luggage and the driver of the car, who introduces himself as Price and explains that he has come in search of his sister Julia.', 'Some time after he leaves, a signal bell is heard to ring in the ticket office, followed by the shrieking whistle of an approaching train.', \"Teddy and Richard try to open the doors and get a look at the train, but the doors won't open.\", 'Teddy and Gander, who suspect trouble, take this opportunity to go outside to do some sleuthing.', 'Price has managed to requisition a bus, but is perplexed to hear from Richard that \"some idiot\\'s been fooling around with a gun outside\".', \"He shows them the bloodstained cloth and begins to explain about the hoax behind the ghost train; someone has taken advantage of the accident and a local superstition to make their job easier, except that it didn't work on him and his fellow passengers.\", 'This ghost train, he adds, \"happens to be as real as the Plymouth Express\".', 'But before he can elaborate on this, Jackie points out that Gander was the reason for them being here in the first place.', 'They carry him to the bus with their luggage, and are just about to start away when Gander arrives in time to catch it.', 'When at last Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard for what he had done, for now there will be no-one to intercept the train on its return journey.', \"Gander remarks that if it is a ghost train, it won't matter if the bridge is open - and points out that that was what he had done a few moments back.\", 'Dr Sterling suddenly moves towards the front of the bus at this point and orders the driver to stop, while Julia and her brother hold everyone at gunpoint.', 'He tells the driver that the bridge is open, and orders him to turn back so that they can warn the train.', 'Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the \"ghost train\" from a nearby beach.', 'As it turns out, Saul Hodgkin is very much alive and in the thick of the business.', 'He flags the train off and climbs aboard as they start away with their illegal cargo.', 'On the bus, Teddy explains to Richard that the \"ghost train\" is really a gunrunners\\' train being used by Fifth Columnists sympathetic to the Nazi movement, with Price as their leader.', 'Price and Sterling order the driver to stop, and Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try and stop the train, but it pays little heed to them as it hurtles towards the bridge.', 'At the same time, the driver of the ghost train realises too late that the bridge is open, and applies his brakes.', 'Afterwards, Teddy discreetly explains to Gander that, \"confidentially\", he isn\\'t whom he makes himself out to be, indicating that he may officially have been sent to investigate the case for British Intelligence.']\n",

novel: \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\", to the images of a ruined country manor.She continues that she can never return to Manderley &mdash; as it no longer exists, except as a ruin.Joan Fontaine plays a young woman of age 21 , an orphan, who works as a paid companion to the wealthy Edythe Van Hopper .In Monte Carlo, she meets the aristocratic widower Maximilian  de Winter  and they fall in love.Within weeks, they decide to get married.Maxim takes his new bride to Manderley, his country house in Cornwall, England.The servants accept the new Mrs. de Winter as the new lady of the house.The exception is the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers , who is particularly unpleasant to the new bride.She is still obsessed with the beauty and sophistication of the first Mrs. de Winter—the eponymous Rebecca—and preserves her former bedroom as a shrine, even cherishing her handmade underwear and expensive négligée.Rebecca's \"cousin\" Jack   appears at the house when Maxim is away, and evidently knows Mrs. Danvers well, calling her by the name \"Danny\", which was Rebecca's pet name for her.The new Mrs. de Winter is intimidated by Mrs. Danvers and by the responsibilities of being the new mistress of Manderley.As a result, she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband.The continuous presence of Rebecca in the house starts to haunt her, and she convinces herself that Maxim is still in love with Rebecca.She discovers, too, that her husband has a fiery temper, and sometimes erupts at apparently innocent actions on her part.Trying to act the perfect wife, Mrs. de Winter suggests to Maxim that they host a costume party as he used to do with Rebecca.Maxim reluctantly consents.Mrs. de Winter excitedly plans her own costume in secret, but Mrs. Danvers suggests that she copy the dress of Caroline de Winter, an ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the upstairs hallway.On the night of the party, Mrs. de Winter reveals her costume to Maxim, who is both surprised and angry at her, shouting at her to change her costume.Mrs. de Winter rushes upstairs, sees Mrs. Danvers go into Rebecca's room and follows her.There she confronts Mrs. Danvers about her knowing that Rebecca had worn the same costume at a previous ball.Mrs. Danvers retaliates by saying that she will never take Rebecca's place and tries to convince Mrs. de Winter to commit suicide.She spots a distant glow from the cottage on the shore and enters to find Maxim.Maxim admits to his new wife that he had earlier misidentified another body as Rebecca's in order to prevent discovery of the truth.From almost the beginning of their marriage, when Rebecca broke the news to him of her own promiscuous nature, he and Rebecca had hated one another.They had agreed to a sordid deal: she would act the perfect wife and hostess in public, preserving his family honour and her position, while he ignored her discreetly-conducted affairs.Rebecca, however, began to get \"careless\" after a while, for example disappearing for days on end to London and then returning as though nothing was wrong.Maxim was also aware of Rebecca's ongoing affair with Jack.One night, expecting to find Rebecca and Jack together, Maxim came down to the cottage.Rebecca had been expecting Jack.She told Maxim that she was pregnant with Jack's child.During the ensuing argument, she fell, hit her head, and died.Shedding her girlish innocence, Maxim's wife immediately starts coaching her husband on how best to conceal the facts of Rebecca's death from the authorities.Privately, Jack shows Maxim a letter from Rebecca urging him excitedly to meet her, which seems to suggest she was not suicidal.Maxim nevertheless comes under suspicion of murder and the second Mrs. de Winter must face the prospect of losing her husband.The investigation focuses on Rebecca's secret visits to a London doctor , which Jack presumes was due to her illicit pregnancy.However, the coroner's interview with the doctor in the presence of Maxim and Jack reveals that Rebecca was mistaken in believing herself pregnant, and was in fact suffering from terminal cancer.Only Maxim and his wife will be able to understand the full story: that Rebecca had lied to Maxim about being pregnant with another man's child so as to goad him, in full knowledge of his family pride and easily-roused temper, into killing her{{spaced

ones, and April is horrified to know that, in order to accomplish this, he has decided she has to have a baby.Her complaints fall on deaf ears to Ivan, who charges his press agent, Patsy Riley, with the job of finding one for a publicity stunt.Meanwhile, Patsy is met by Myra Prottle, the president of the Chicago April Tremaine Club.Patsy is just showing her into Ivan's compartment when she is called away, and when Ivan eventually emerges, he doesn't immediately recognise Miss Prottle and firmly orders her out.She re-enters shortly after on Patsy's prompting, but this time she is on hand to explain who exactly Miss Prottle is to Ivan before he can get rid of her again, whereupon Ivan takes out his annoyance on her at his own mistake and orders her to leave him and Miss Prottle in peace.In her own compartment, April is having trouble with the baby again, but isn't sure how to stop him crying.Thinking that he may be hungry, she leaves him in Patsy's care and goes to the buffet in the observation lounge, where she unexpectedly meets up with her childhood sweetheart, Dr Harvey North, who remembers her by her real name of Mary Potter.Their brief gossip is interrupted when Patsy reminds April about the baby; Harvey, who is especially gifted with children, follows to see if he can help.When they get back to April's compartment, she confides in Patsy that Ivan may have a point in what he had said on their way to the station, about being at home, nurturing her very own child - and a young husband.Realising that she is thinking of marrying Harvey, Patsy rushes back to Ivan's compartment to break the news to him.Meanwhile, Harvey is rather taken aback by the baby's similar appearance to April's, almost as if he were her own.April tries to explain that it is merely a publicity stunt, but Harvey cannot bring himself to believe this, and when she asks for Ivan's support, unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady, he denies that he had anything to do with it.Displeased at being fooled, Harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon, and an angry April forces Ivan and Patsy out of her compartment along with the baby.Patsy enters the dining car a little later with April and Miss Prottle.Seeing Harvey at Mike's table, April tries once again to reason with him, but Harvey still doesn't believe her.In the end she gets her way by telling him that Ivan was the father.Eventually, Patsy and Miss Prottle head off to help April with the baby, but before she leaves, Patsy and Mike agree to meet in the observation car later on.By this time, Patsy and Miss Prottle have the baby ready for bed, but Miss Prottle insists on staying up late to listen to \"Renfrew of the Mounted\", a radio series of which she is a big fan.In the observation saloon, \"Renfrew of the Mounted\" is just finishing when Mike comes in and tries to explain their dilemma to Patsy while Miss Prottle takes charge of the baby, but Patsy is so annoyed at his anxious rambling that she mistakes it for lack of interest in her, and accordingly walks out on him.Later that night, Patsy is woken by a sleepless Mike, who tells her that, unbeknown to him until too late, the baby had been kidnapped.Thankfully, Patsy has a plan, and puts Mike in charge of the baby until they get a chance to drop him off at a station.Patsy overhears and rushes Miss Prottle back to bed before repeating to Ivan what Mike had told her.Meanwhile, April is woken up to find the baby on her bedside table.Although confused at first as to how the baby got into her compartment and why he is wide awake, she sees a chance to make up her dispute with Harvey, and asks the porter to send for him.By this time April is beginning to realise just how right Ivan was about babies, and expresses to Harvey a desire to have one of her own.Ivan's words are still playing on Harvey's mind, however, and he is therefore rather pessimistic about this until April tells him that she has had enough of making films with Ivan.They both head off to Ivan's compartment, where April confesses her love to Harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as Ivan opens his door.Ivan is horrified, not only because Harvey went back on his word, but also at April's intention to quit from Hollywood and marry Harvey.Patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on April's bed.Ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with April; as soon as the policeman enters, April pretends to be distraught while Ivan keeps him occupied for a short while.Back in Patsy's compartment, Mike comes to inform Patsy that everything is under control - but Patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment.Patsy sends him to get the baby, and Mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero's welcome, instantly obliges.Patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round

Lourdes, Bernadette is left behind when her companions warn her not to wade through the cold river by the Massabielle caves for fear of taking ill.

rosary.She tells her sister and friend, who promise not to tell anyone else, but of course they do, and the story soon spreads all over town.Many, including Bernadette's Aunt Bernarde , are convinced

work, but also emotional abuse from a cold and sinister Sister Vauzous, her former teacher at school, and who is mistress of novices here.Sister Vauzous is skeptically jealous of all the attention Bernadette has been receiving as a result of the visions.She reveals this to Bernadette, saying she is angry that God would choose Bernadette instead of her when she has spent her life in suffering in service of God.She says Bernadette has not suffered enough and wants a \"sign\" proving Bernadette really was chosen by Heaven.Bernadette is diagnosed with tuberculosis of the bone, which causes intense pain, yet she has never complained or so much as mentioned it.The jealous sister, realizing her wrongness and Bernadette's saintliness, begs for forgiveness in the chapel, and vows to serve

terrified young woman in black.The stranger pleads for help, saying that someone is coming for her, but there is something she has to see.He adds that she suffers from delusions, and is normally kept under observation.Price further explains that she once thought she had seen the ghost train, and this was such a shock to her that has retained a fascination for it ever since, and experiences compulsions to try and see it again.When they explain to Price what had happened, Julia insinuates that it was actually Ted Holmes.Dr Sterling suggests that Julia remains at the station until she realises that the ghost train doesn't exist.Price reluctantly concedes, but insists before he leaves that Julia comes back with him as soon as he can find a car.As it thunders through the station, Julia smashes a window to get a look at the train, but faints the moment she sees it.Dr Sterling makes her comfortable on one of the waiting room benches and requests for a glass of water.Julia hears it from the waiting room, and claims that Ben Isaacs, the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back just as he had after the accident - out of his mind and singing \"Rock of Ages\".Julia insists
