**Character Name:** Auguste "Augie" LaFleur

**Background:** Augie is a 32-year-old former singer who was part of a popular jazz band in New Orleans during the 1950s. After a tragic accident involving a train, which he claims was a ghostly apparition, Augie's grip on reality began to slip. He now lives in Los Angeles, working as a private investigator and occasional narrator for Perry Mason.

**Physical Appearance:** Augie is a slender, charismatic man with a mop of curly dark hair and piercing green eyes. His features are often described as "melancholy" or " haunted," reflecting the turmoil he's experienced since the train accident. He has a habit of wearing crumpled suits and scuffed dress shoes, which gives him a slightly disheveled appearance.

**Age:** Augie is now in his early 30s, but he often looks younger due to his perpetual air of melancholy.

**Occupation:** As a private investigator, Augie uses his musical background and people skills to gather information and piece together seemingly unrelated clues. He's also an occasional narrator for Perry Mason cases, which allows him to use his analytical mind to help unravel mysteries.

**Personality:** Augie is a complex individual with a deep sense of vulnerability. His experiences after the train accident have left him with episodes of delusion and hallucination, but he's learned to channel these into his work as an investigator. He's fiercely independent and has a tendency to push people away when they get too close, fearing that those around him will become entangled in his own troubles.

**Daily Life:** Augie spends most of his time working with Perry Mason on various cases, often using his musical talents to gather information from witnesses or suspects. Outside of work, he's haunted by the ghostly apparitions that haunt his dreams and occasionally manifests themselves in real life. To cope, Augie turns to whiskey and jazz records, which serve as a reminder of his past life as a performer.

**Quirks:** Augie has a habit of humming or whistling softly when he's deep in thought, often accompanied by an air of introspection. He's also prone to sudden mood swings, particularly when faced with unsettling or disturbing situations. Despite this, Augie is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect them.

**Secrets:** Augie has a few secrets that he keeps hidden from the world. Firstly, his experiences after the train accident are more than just hallucinations â€“ he genuinely believes that the ghostly apparition was trying to communicate with him about something important. Secondly, Augie's past as a performer is not entirely forgotten, and he occasionally receives mysterious messages or gifts from an unknown sender, hinting at a lingering connection to his former life.

This fictitious character combines elements of Perry Mason's trusted allies (like Gander and Teddy) with the complexities of Augie LaFleur's troubled personality.
