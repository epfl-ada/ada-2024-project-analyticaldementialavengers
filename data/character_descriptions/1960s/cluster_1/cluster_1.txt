**Character Profile**

Name: Ryder Kaelin

Background: Ryder was born into a humble farming family in a small village on a distant planet. He grew up with strong values of honesty, hard work, and kindness, which were instilled by his parents. However, as he entered adulthood, Ryder became increasingly drawn to the thrill of adventure and the allure of power.

Age: 28

Physical Appearance: Ryder stands at 5'10" with an athletic build, piercing blue eyes, and short, dark hair. He has a strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident. He often wears his hair messy and unkempt, giving off a rugged, adventurous vibe.

Occupation: Ryder is a skilled driver and mechanic, having inherited the latter skillset from his father. However, he's also become embroiled in organized crime, using his driving skills to transport contraband and evade law enforcement.

Personality: Ryder combines the cunning and charisma of Paolo Maltese with the bravery and recklessness of Lawrence of Arabia. He's a natural-born leader who inspires loyalty in those around him, but he's also willing to take extreme risks and make tough decisions when necessary. Thinna's detachment and ruthlessness have also influenced Ryder, making him more calculating and efficient in his approach.

Daily Life: Ryder lives a double life, working as a mechanic by day and using his driving skills for illicit activities at night. He's constantly looking over his shoulder, knowing that the police or rival gangs could be waiting around every corner. Despite this, he remains optimistic and focused on his goals, often taking time to appreciate the beauty of the world around him.

Ryder is also haunted by a tragedy from his past: the loss of his younger sister in a brutal gang attack. This event has left him with a deep sense of anger and a desire for justice, which he channels into his crime-fighting activities.

As Ryder navigates the complexities of his life, he's constantly drawn to Vani-like defiance, using his artistry and creativity to express himself in ways that challenge societal norms. However, this also makes him more vulnerable to the machinations of those around him, including Kannan's cunning manipulations.

In the end, Ryder's strength lies in his ability to adapt, use his wits, and drive forward with determination, even in the face of overwhelming odds.
