**Daily Life:** Eli spends most of his days exploring abandoned buildings, taking photos, and writing in a journal. He's an early riser and often starts his day with a solo walk in the nearby woods, where he finds solace in nature. In the evenings, he likes to unwind with a whiskey at a local bar, listening to indie folk music and observing the people around him.

**Quirks:** Eli has a habit of carrying a small, silver locket containing a lock of his mother's hair. He also collects antique cameras and often uses them to capture unique perspectives. When he's on a shoot, he likes to wear a pair of silver earrings shaped like snakes, which remind him of his rebellious teenage years.

**Fears:** Eli's greatest fear is losing the people he loves or being trapped in a situation that feels suffocating. He also has a deep-seated fear of failing as an artist and not leaving a lasting impact on the world.
