1970s
The 1970s (pronounced "nineteen-seventies"; commonly
shortened to the "Seventies" or the " '70s") was the decade
that began on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31,
1979.
In the 21st century, historians have increasingly portrayed
the 1970s as a "pivot of change" in world history, focusing
especially on the economic upheavals[1] that followed the
end of the postwar economic boom.[2] On a global scale, it
was characterized by frequent coups, domestic conflicts
and civil wars, and various political upheavals and armed
conflicts which arose from or were related to
decolonization, and the global struggle between NATO, the
Warsaw Pact, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Many
regions had periods of high-intensity conflict, notably
Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and
Africa.
In the Western world, social progressive values that began
in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and
economic liberty of women, continued to grow. In the
United Kingdom, the 1979 election resulted in the victory
of its Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, the first
female British Prime Minister. Industrialized countries
experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis
caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first
instance of stagflation which began a political and
economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic
theory with neoliberal economic theory, with the first
neoliberal government coming to power with the 1973
Chilean coup d'état.

Clockwise from top left: U.S. President Richard Nixon
doing the V for Victory sign after his resignation from
office following the Watergate scandal in 1974; The
United States was still involved in the Vietnam War in
the early decade. The New York Times leaked
information regarding the nation's involvement in the
war. Political pressure led to America's withdrawal from
the war in 1973, and the Fall of Saigon in 1975 leading
to evacuations of South Vietnamese that same year; the
1973 oil crisis causes a financial crisis throughout the
developed world; both the leaders of Israel and Egypt
shake hands after the signing of the Camp David
Accords in 1978; in 1971, the Pakistan Armed Forces
commits the 1971 Bangladesh genocide to curb
independence movements in East Pakistan, killing
300,000 to 3,000,000 people; this consequently leads to
the Bangladesh Liberation War; the 1970 Bhola
cyclone kills an estimated 500,000 people in the
densely populated Ganges Delta region of East
Pakistan in November 1970, and became the deadliest
natural disaster in 40 years; the Iranian Revolution of
1979 ousts Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who is later
replaced by an Islamic theocracy led by Ayatollah
Khomeini; the popularity of the disco music genre and
subculture peaks during the mid-to-late 1970s.

The 1970s was also an era of great technological and
scientific advances; since the appearance of the first
commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004 in 1971, the
decade was characterised by a profound transformation of
computing units – by then rudimentary, spacious machines
– into the realm of portability and home accessibility. There
were also great advances in fields such as physics, which
saw the consolidation of quantum field theory at the end of
the decade, mainly thanks to the confirmation of the
existence of quarks and the detection of the first gauge bosons in addition to the photon, the Z boson and the gluon,
part of what was christened in 1975 as the Standard Model.

In Asia, the People's Republic of China's international relations changed significantly following its recognition by
the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors.
Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period,
overtaking the economy of West Germany to become the second-largest in the world.[3] The United States withdrew
its military forces from the Vietnam War. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, which led to the Soviet–
Afghan War.
The 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, starting
the Yom Kippur War, but in the late 1970s, the situation was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the
Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution in 1979, which
overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established an Islamic republic under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini.
Africa saw further decolonization in the decade, with Angola and Mozambique gaining their independence in 1975
from the Portuguese Empire after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal. Furthermore, Spain withdrew its claim over
Spanish Sahara in 1976, marking the formal end of the Spanish Empire. The continent was, however, plagued by
endemic military coups, with the long-reigning Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie being removed, civil wars and
famine.
The economies of much of the developing world continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of
the Green Revolution. However, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis, although it boomed afterwards.
The 1970s saw the world population increase from 3.7 to 4.4 billion, with approximately 1.23 billion births and 475
million deaths occurring during the decade.

The Ogaden War (1977–1978) was another African conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia over
control of the Ogaden region.
The Rhodesian Bush War (1964–1979)

International conflicts
The most notable International conflicts of the decade include:

Major conflict between capitalist and communist forces in multiple
countries, while attempts are made by the Soviet Union and the United
States to lessen the chance for conflict, such as both countries endorsing
nuclear nonproliferation.
In June 1976, peaceful student protests in the Soweto township of South
Africa by black students against the use of Afrikaans in schools led to the
Soweto uprising which killed more than 176 people, overwhelmingly by
South Africa's Security Police.[4]
Rise of separatism in the province of Quebec in Canada. In 1970, radical
Quebec nationalist and Marxist militants of the Front de libération du
Québec (FLQ) kidnapped the Quebec labour minister Pierre Laporte and
British Trade Commissioner James Cross during the October Crisis,
resulting in Laporte being killed, and the enactment of martial law in
Canada under the War Measures Act, resulting in a campaign by the
1979 Iranian Revolution
Canadian government which arrests suspected FLQ supporters. The
election of the Parti Québécois led by René Lévesque in the province of
Quebec in Canada, brings the first political party committed to Quebec
independence into power in Quebec. Lévesque's government pursues an agenda to secede Quebec
from Canada by democratic means and strengthen Francophone Québécois culture in the late 1970s,
such as the controversial Charter of the French Language more commonly known in Quebec and
Canada as "Bill 101".
Martial law was declared in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, by dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
In Cambodia, the communist leader Pol Pot led a revolution against the American-backed government
of Lon Nol. On April 17, 1975, Pot's forces captured Phnom Penh, the capital, two years after America
had halted the bombings of their positions. His communist government, the Khmer Rouge, forced
people out of the cities to clear jungles and establish a radical, Marxist agrarian society. Buddhist
priests and monks, along with anyone who spoke foreign languages, had any sort of education, or
even wore glasses were tortured or killed. As many as 3 million people may have died. Vietnam
invaded the country at the start of 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a satellite
government. This provoked a brief, but furious border war with China in February of that year.
The Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed Iran from an autocratic pro-Western monarchy under
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to a theocratic Islamist government under the leadership of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. Distrust between the revolutionaries and Western powers led to the Iran hostage
crisis on November 4, 1979, where 66 diplomats, mainly from the United States, were held captive for
444 days.
Growing internal tensions take place in Yugoslavia beginning with the Croatian Spring movement in
1971 which demands greater decentralization of power to the constituent republics of Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia's communist ruler Joseph Broz Tito subdues the Croatian Spring movement and arrests its
leaders, but does initiate major constitutional reform resulting in the 1974 Constitution which
decentralized powers to the republics, gave them the official right to separate from Yugoslavia, and
weakened the influence of Serbia (Yugoslavia's largest and most populous constituent republic) in the
federation by granting significant powers to the Serbian autonomous provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina. In addition, the 1974 Constitution consolidated Tito's dictatorship by proclaiming him
president-for-life. The 1974 Constitution would become resented by Serbs and began a gradual
escalation of ethnic tensions.

Coups
The most prominent coups d'état of the decade include:
1970 – Coup in Syria, led by Hafez al-Assad.
1971 – Military coup in Uganda led by Idi Amin.
1973 – Coup d'état in Chile on September 11th, Salvador Allende was overthrown and killed in a
military attack on the presidential palace. Augusto Pinochet takes power backed by the military junta.
1974 – Military coup in Ethiopia led to the overthrowing of Haile Selassie by the communist junta led
by General Aman Andom and Mengistu Haile Mariam, ending one of the world's longest-lasting
monarchies in history.

1974 – (25 April) Carnation Revolution in Portugal started as a military
coup organized by the Armed Forces Movement (Portuguese: Movimento
das Forças Armadas, MFA) composed of military officers who opposed
the Portuguese fascist regime, but the movement was soon coupled with
an unanticipated and popular campaign of civil support. It would
ultimately lead to the decolonization of all its colonies, but leave power
vacuums that led to civil war in newly independent Lusophone African
nations.
1975 – Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, President of Bangladesh, and almost his
entire family was assassinated in the early hours of August 15, 1975,
when a group of Bangladesh Army personnel went to his residence and
killed him, during a coup d'état.
1976 – Jorge Rafael Videla seizes control of Argentina in 1976 through a

1979 – an Attempted coup in Iran, backed by the United States, to
overthrow the interim government, which had come to power after the
Iranian Revolution.
1979 – Coup in El Salvador, President General Carlos Humberto Romero, was overthrown by junior
ranked officers, who formed a Junta government, which lead to the beginning of a 12-year civil war.

Terrorist attacks
The most notable terrorist attacks of the decade include:
The Munich massacre takes place at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, where
Palestinians belonging to the terrorist group Black September organization kidnapped and murdered
eleven Israeli athletes.
Rise in the use of terrorism by militant organizations across the world. Groups in Europe like the Red
Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof Gang were responsible for a spate of bombings, kidnappings, and
murders. Violence continued in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. Radical American groups
existed as well, such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, but they
never achieved the size or strength of their European counterparts.
On September 6, 1970, the world witnessed the beginnings of modern rebellious fighting in what is
today called as Skyjack Sunday. Palestinian terrorists hijacked four airliners and took over 300 people
on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up.

Prominent political events
Worldwide
1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis
The presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state and heads of government
in a number of countries across the world, many being the first women to hold such positions, such as
Soong Ching-ling continuing as the first Chairwoman of the People's Republic of China until 1972,
Isabel Perón as the first woman President in Argentina in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, Elisabeth
Domitien becomes the first woman Prime Minister of Central African Republic, Indira Gandhi
continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977, Lidia Gueiler Tejada becoming the interim President
of Bolivia beginning from 1979 to 1980, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo becoming the first woman Prime
Minister of Portugal in 1979, and Margaret Thatcher becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom in 1979.
Americas
United States President Richard Nixon resigned as president on August 9, 1974, while facing charges
for impeachment for the Watergate scandal.

Augusto Pinochet rose to power as ruler of Chile after
overthrowing the country's Socialist president Salvador Allende in
1973 with the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
of the United States. Pinochet would remain the dictator of Chile
until 1990.
Argentine president Isabel Perón begins the Dirty War, where the
military and security forces hunt down left-wing political dissidents
as part of Operation Condor. She is overthrown in a military coup
in 1976, and Jorge Rafael Videla comes to power and continues
the Dirty War until the military junta relinquished power in 1983.
Suriname was granted independence from the Netherlands on
November 25, 1975.
In Guyana, the Rev. Jim Jones led several hundred people from
his People's Temple in California to create and maintain a Utopian
Marxist commune in the jungle named Jonestown. Amid
allegations of corruption, mental, sexual, and physical abuse by
Jones on his followers, and denying them the right to leave
Jonestown, a Congressional committee and journalists visited
Guyana to investigate in November 1978. The visitors (and

depart Guyana together. Congressman Leo Ryan was among
those who were shot to death. The demented Jones then ordered
everyone in the commune to commit suicide. The people drank or were forced to drink, cyanide-laced
fruit punch (Flavor Aid). A total of over 900 dead were found (approximately 1/3 of which were
children), including Jones, who had shot himself. Multiple units of the United States military were
organized, mobilized, and sent to Guyana to recover over 900 deceased Jonestown residents. After
rejections from the Guyanese Government for the United States to bury the Jonestown dead in
Guyana, US military personnel were then tasked to prepare and transport the human remains from
Guyana for burial in the USA. The US General Accounting Office later detailed an approximate cost of
$4.4 million (in taxpayer dollars) for Jonestown's clean-up and recovery operation expenses.
The Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua is ousted in 1979 by the Sandinista National Liberation Front,
leading to the Contra War in the 1980s.
Greenland was granted self-government (or "home rule") within the Kingdom of Denmark on
November 29, 1979.[5][6]
Europe
Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative party rose to power in the
United Kingdom in 1979, initiating a neoliberal economic policy of
reducing government spending, weakening the power of trade
unions, and promoting economic and trade liberalization.
Francisco Franco died after 39 years in power. Juan Carlos I was
crowned king of Spain and called for the reintroduction of
democracy. The dictatorship in Spain ended. The first general
elections were held in 1977 and Adolfo Suárez became Prime
minister of Spain after his Centrist Democratic Union won. The
United States President Jimmy

were a time of extreme recession for East Germany, and as a
result of the country's higher debts, consumer goods became
more and more scarce. If East Germans had enough money to procure a television set, a telephone,
or a Trabant automobile, they were placed on waiting lists which caused them to wait as much as a
decade for the item in question.
The Troubles in Northern Ireland continued, with an explosion of political violence erupting in the early
1970s. Notable attacks include the McGurk's Car bombing, the Bloody Sunday massacre, and the
Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

The Soviet Union under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev, having the largest armed forces and the
largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, pursued an agenda to lessen tensions with its rival
superpower, the United States, for most of the seventies. That policy, known as détente, abruptly
ended with the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan at the end of 1979. While known as a "period of
stagnation" in Soviet historiography, the Seventies are largely considered as a sort of a golden age of
the USSR in terms of stability and relative well-being. Nevertheless, hidden inflation continued to
increase for the second straight decade, and production consistently fell short of demand in
agriculture and consumer goods manufacturing. By the end of the 1970s, signs of social and
economic stagnation were becoming very pronounced.
Enver Hoxha's rule in Albania was characterized in the 1970s by growing isolation, first from a very
public schism with the Soviet Union the decade before, and then by a split in friendly relations with
China in 1978. Albania normalized relations with Yugoslavia in 1971, and attempted trade agreements
with other European nations, but was met with vocal disapproval by the United Kingdom and the
United States.
In 1977 the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was the international celebration marking the 25th
anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the thrones of seven countries.
1978 would become known as the "Year of Three Popes". In August, Paul VI, who had ruled since
1963, died. His successor was Cardinal Albino Luciano, who took the name John Paul. But only 33
days later, he was found dead, and the Catholic Church had to elect another pope. On October 16,
Karol Wojtyła, a Polish cardinal, was elected, becoming Pope John Paul II. He was the first non-Italian
pope since 1523.
Asia
On September 17, 1978, the Camp David Accords were signed
between Israel and Egypt. The Accords led directly to the 1979
Egypt–Israel peace treaty. They also resulted in Sadat and Begin
sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.
Major changes in the People's Republic of China. US president

In 1971, the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek, then-President of
the Republic of China (Taiwan), were expelled from the United
Nations and replaced by the People's Republic of China. Chiang
Kai-shek died in 1975, and in 1978 his son Chiang Ching-kuo
became president, beginning a shift towards democratization in
Taiwan.
In Iraq, Saddam Hussein began to rise to power by helping to

modernize the country. One major initiative was removing the
Western monopoly on oil, which later during the high prices of
1973 oil crisis would help Hussein's ambitious plans. On July 16, 1979, he assumed the presidency
cementing his rise to power. His presidency led to the breaking off of a Syrian-Iraqi unification, which
had been sought under his predecessor Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and would lead to the Iran–Iraq War
starting in the 1980s.
Japan's economic growth surpassed the rest of the world in the 1970s, unseating the United States as
the world's foremost industrial power.
On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, took over Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh.
From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge carried out the Cambodian genocide that killed nearly two
million.
On April 13, 1975, the Lebanese Civil War began.

Africa
Idi Amin, President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, after rising to
power in a coup became infamous for his brutal dictatorship in
Uganda. Amin's regime persecuted opposition to his rule and
pursued a racist agenda of removing Asians from Uganda
(particularly Indians who arrived in Uganda during British colonial
rule). Amin initiated the Ugandan–Tanzanian War in 1978 in
alliance with Libya based on an expansionist agenda to annex
territory from Tanzania which resulted in Ugandan defeat and
Amin's overthrow in 1979.
Idi Amin
South African activist Steve Biko died in 1977.
Francisco Macías Nguema ruled Equatorial Guinea as a brutal
dictator from 1969 until his overthrow and execution in 1979.
Jean-Bédel Bokassa, who had ruled the Central African Republic since 1965, proclaimed himself
Emperor Bokassa I and renamed his impoverished country the Central African Empire in 1977. He
was overthrown two years later and went into exile.

On March 28, 1979, there was a partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor in
Pennsylvania, United States. It is the most significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant
history.

Worldwide trends
Superpower tensions had cooled by the 1970s, with the bellicose US–Soviet confrontations of the 1950s–60s giving
way to the policy of détente, which promoted the idea that the world's problems could be resolved at the negotiating
table. Détente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the world

dangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following
the failure of the Vietnam War. As part of détente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China,
partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.
The US–Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as
the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries. American and Soviet intelligence
agencies gave funding, training, and material support to insurgent groups, governments, and armies across the globe,
each seeking to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism
went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist
groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive
dictatorship. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundamentalism, as the Shi'a theocracy of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and
godless communism.
People were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society
in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical social structure.
The Green Revolution of the late 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food in many developing economies. At
the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently
saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social communities amid increasing information blockade
across social class.
Another common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women
in industrialized societies. More women could enter the workforce. However, the gender role of men remained as
that of a breadwinner. The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women
entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The Iranian revolution also affected global attitudes toward and
among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.
The global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global zeitgeist revealed the
interdependence of economies since World War II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and
the Soviet Union.

Economy
The 1970s were perhaps the worst decade of most industrialized countries' economic performance since the Great
Depression.[18] Although there was no severe economic depression as witnessed in the 1930s, economic growth
rates were considerably lower than previous decades. As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the
prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 added to the existing ailments
and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries
began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus (as of 2009) in 1975. In contrast,
Japan and West Germany experienced economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading
manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-largest economy.[3] Japan
would rank as the world's second-largest economy until 1994 when the European Economic Area (18 countries
under a single market) came into effect.
In the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approximately 2.5%. From 1970 to 1979,
however, the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.[19] This period is also known
for "stagflation", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit
interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the
highest in history.[18] A rising cost of housing was reflected in the average price of a new home in the U.S. The
average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when
U.S. President Jimmy Carter was running for re-election against Ronald Reagan, the misery index (the sum of the
unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.[20] The economic problems of the
1970s would result in a sluggish cynicism replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of
government and technology. Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate,
as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election. There was also the 1973–74
stock market crash.

Great Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved
unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost
paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the Winter of Discontent, Margaret Thatcher was elected prime
minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.
In Eastern Europe, Soviet-style command economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were
persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particularly Soviet, exports, but a growing
inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the COMECON block, and a
growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.
On the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially
by the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan),
resulted in rapid economic transformation and industrialization. Their
abundance of cheap labor, combined with educational and other policy
reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s
and beyond.

Oil crisis

June 15, 1979.

Economically, the 1970s were marked by the energy crisis which peaked in
1973 and 1979 (see 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis). After the first oil
shock in 1973, gasoline was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil;
the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced
car-free days and weekends. In the United States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only
allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbered days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on
even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not
sustainable without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progress that had existed since
the 19th century. As a result, ecological awareness rose substantially, which had a major effect on the economy.

Science and technology
Science
The 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the
integrated circuit, and the laser. Stephen Hawking developed his theories of black holes and the boundary-condition
of the universe at this period with his theory called Hawking radiation. The biological sciences greatly advanced,
with molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade.
Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and Stephen Jay Gould's theory of punctuated
equilibrium revolutionized evolutionary thought.
Space exploration
As the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful crewed lunar landings. Many Americans lost interest
afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President John F. Kennedy's goal of landing on the Moon
by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions
of dollars spent on the space program should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but
the near loss of the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 served to further anti-NASA feelings. Plans for missions up to
Apollo 20 were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and Saturn hardware was used for the Skylab space station
program in 1973–1974, and for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of
the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it
would devote most of the decade to the development of the Space Shuttle. ASTP was the last crewed American

space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA
had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to
save it.
Meanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By
then, however, they had already begun Salyut, the world's first space station program, which began in 1971. This
would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the Soyuz 11 crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the
Soyuz 18a crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months
being conducted by the end of the decade.
In terms of uncrewed missions, a variety of lunar and planetary probes were launched by the US and Soviet
programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet Lunokhod program, a series of robotic
lunar missions which included the first uncrewed sample return from another world, and the American Voyagers,
which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except Pluto by the end of the
1980s.
China entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first satellite, but technological backwardness and
limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a
satellite for the first time in 1972. The European Space Agency was founded during the decade as well.

Social science
Social science intersected with hard science in the works in natural language processing by Terry Winograd (1973)
and the establishment of the first cognitive sciences department in the world at MIT in 1979. The fields of
generative linguistics and cognitive psychology went through a renewed vigor with symbolic modeling of semantic
knowledge while the final devastation of the long-standing tradition of behaviorism came about through the severe
criticism of B. F. Skinner's work in 1971 by the cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky.

Technology

Rail
British Rail introduced high-speed trains on InterCity services. The trains consisted of British Rail Class 43 dieselelectric locomotives at either end with British Rail Mark 3 carriages. The trains were built in the United Kingdom by
British Rail Engineering Limited. The high speed trains ran at 125 miles per hour (201 km/h) speeding up journeys
between towns and cities and is still known as the InterCity 125.
Amtrak was formed in the United States in 1971, assuming responsibility for inter-city passenger operations
throughout the country. In 1976, Conrail was formed to take over the assets of six bankrupt freight railroads in the
northeastern US.
Automobiles

1970 Dodge Challenger Trans Am,
an example of a muscle car in the
earlier part of the decade.

The 1970s was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety
concerns, and emissions controls. The 1973 oil crisis caused a move towards
smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars,
but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars
became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built
subcompact models entered the market. American-made cars such as the
"quirky" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean shaped AMC Pacer, and Pontiac
Firebird's powerful Trans Am "sum up" the decade.[22] Muscle cars and
convertible models faded from favor during the early-1970s. It was believed
that the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado would be the last American-built
convertible; ending the open body style that once dominated the auto
industry.[23]

Cars in the U.S. from the early 1970s are noted more for their power than
their styling, but they even lost their power by Malaise era of the late1970s.[24][25] Styling on American cars became progressively more boxy and
rectilinear during the 1970s,[26] with coupes being the most popular body
style. Wood paneling and shag carpets dominated the interiors. Many
automobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brands
and automakers, as well as featuring "luxury" enhancements such as vinyl
roofs and opera windows.[24] Only a few had "real personalities" such as the
AMC Gremlin, which was America's first modern subcompact, and the AMC
Pacer.[24] "These two cars embody a sense of artful desperation that made
them stand out from the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of
the seventies."[24]

1974 Ford Mustang interior

Automobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors managed to
downsize its full-size models to more manageable dimensions. Ford followed suit two years later, with Chrysler
offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by
various factors. By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy, and under its new president Lee Iacocca (who had been
fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. American Motors beat out the U.S. Big Three to
subcompact sized model (the Gremlin) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a
partnership with the French automaker Renault in 1979.
European car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the
need for performance with high fuel efficiency—designs such as the
Volkswagen Golf and Passat, BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, and Mercedes-Benz SClass appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford
Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The
designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro became dominant, along with those of
Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical
failure of the British car industry—a combination of militant strikes and poor
quality control effectively halted development at British Leyland, owner of
all other British car companies during the 1970s.

The Japanese automobile industry flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese
vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very
important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized
robotic manufacturing techniques and lean manufacturing, contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs.
The Honda Civic was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency. By 1975 Toyota overtook

Volkswagen as the top-selling imported automobile brand in the U.S., with
over a million cars sold per year by this point.[27] Other popular compact cars
included the Toyota Corolla and the Datsun Sunny, in addition to other cars
from those companies and others such as Subaru, Mitsubishi, and Mazda.

Society
Role of women in society

Honda Civic sold well throughout
the decade.

The role of women in society was profoundly
altered with growing feminism across the world and
with the presence and rise of a significant number of
women as heads of state outside monarchies and
heads of government in a number of countries across
the world during the 1970s, many being the first
women to hold such positions. Non-monarch women

Thatcher becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979. Both Indira Gandhi and
Margaret Thatcher would remain important political figures in the following decade in the 1980s.
Pope Paul VI recognized the popularity of Catholic feminists, but ultimately held to tradition when it came to
leaving bishops, priests, and deacons a male-only position.[28]

Social movements
Anti-war protests
The opposition to the War in Vietnam that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s. One of the
best-known anti-war demonstrations was the Kent State shootings. In 1970, university students were protesting the
war and the draft. Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace.
However, by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting.
Four students were killed and nine were injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and
became a staple of anti-Vietnam demonstrations.
Environmentalism

The 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the environmental issues early
activists from the 1960s, such as Rachel Carson and Murray Bookchin, had
warned of. The Apollo 11 mission, which had occurred at the end of the
previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an
integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to
preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first Earth
Day, in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten
thousand primary and secondary schools participated.
Sexual revolution

War in Washington, D.C., on April
24, 1971.

The 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing
social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world.
The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe
was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as nudity in film and on TV had
been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing
women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and
Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in
the 1980s to 1990s.
The market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer
population, and the 1972 movie Behind the Green Door, an X-rated feature, became one of the top-grossing films of
the year. Playboy Magazine appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed
magazines such as Penthouse Magazine and Hustler Magazine.
By the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the
AIDS epidemic helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in
numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay in the US, declined as pornographic
movies would largely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.
Crime and urban decay
Crime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a
complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious
cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital
punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later.
Feminism
The Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had
begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role
within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution (which legalized female
suffrage) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality
and other protests.

A Women's Liberation march in
Washington, D.C., 1970

1971 saw Erin Pizzey establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in
Chiswick, London and Pizzey and her colleagues opened further facilities
throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in
other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in Amsterdam in 1974.[29][30]

With the anthology Sisterhood is Powerful and other works, such as Sexual Politics, being published at the start of
the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before. In addition, the Supreme Court's 1973
decision of Roe v. Wade, which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement
into the national political spotlight.
Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Betty Ford, Shirley Chisholm, Bella Abzug, Robin Morgan, Kate Millett and
Elizabeth Holtzman, among many others, led the movement for women's equality.
Even musically, the women's movement had its shining moment. Australian-American singer Helen Reddy, recorded
the song "I Am Woman", which became an anthem for the women's liberation movement. "I Am Woman" reached
No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.
Another movement to arise was the 1970s Goddess movement, which took place to combat patriarchal ideas of
religion.[31][32]
Most efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws,
were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained
unheard of success in business, politics, education, science, the law, and even the home. Although most aims of the
movement were successful, however, there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the
Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify
ERA in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the wage
gap failed to close, but it did become smaller.
The second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982 with the failure of the Equal Rights
Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C.. American women created a brief, but
powerful, third-wave in the early 1990s which addressed sexual harassment (inspired by the Anita Hill–Clarence
Thomas Senate Judiciary Committee hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of
such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, particularly the United
States Senate.
Civil rights
The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves
more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist movement grew out of frustrations with
the "non-violent" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr. and June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, many Black people were compelled to reject ideas of
negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil
Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the "woman's turn", though many feminists incorporated civil rights
ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership position of the civil rights movement from
her husband, Coretta Scott King, as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping
and encouraging the Woman's Liberation movement, and other movements as well. At the National Women's
Conference in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in
the movement's goals. Similarly, the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of
political figures such as Harvey Milk to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation
passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including Freddie Mercury and Andy Warhol, also
"came out" during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.
Youth suffrage

The Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting
age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact
that young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War before they were old enough to vote.[33]
