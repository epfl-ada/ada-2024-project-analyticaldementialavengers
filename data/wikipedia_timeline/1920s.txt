1920s
The 1920s (pronounced "nineteen-twenties" often
shortened to the "'20s" or the "Twenties") was a decade
that began on January 1, 1920, and ended on December 31,
1929. Primarily known for the economic boom that
occurred in the Western World following the end of World
War I (1914–1918), the decade is frequently referred to as
the "Roaring Twenties" or the "Jazz Age" in America and
Western Europe, and the "Golden Twenties" in Germany,
while French speakers refer to the period as the "Années
folles" ('crazy years') to emphasize the decade's social,
artistic, and cultural dynamism.[1]
The devastating Wall Street Crash in October 1929 is
generally viewed as a harbinger of the end of 1920s
prosperity in North America and Europe. In the Soviet
Union, the New Economic Policy was created by the
Bolsheviks in 1921, to be replaced by the first five-year
plan in 1928. The 1920s saw the rise of radical political
movements, with the Red Army triumphing against White
movement forces in the Russian Civil War, and the
emergence of far-right political movements in Europe. In
1922, the fascist leader Benito Mussolini seized power in
Italy. Other dictators that emerged included Józef Piłsudski
in Poland, and Peter and Alexander Karađorđević in
Yugoslavia. First-wave feminism made advances, with
women gaining the right to vote in the United States
(1920), Albania (1920), Ireland (1921), and with suffrage
being expanded in Britain to all women over 21 years old
(1928).

In Turkey, nationalist forces defeated Greece, France,
Armenia, and Britain in the Turkish War of Independence,
leading to the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), a treaty more
favorable to Turkey than the earlier proposed Treaty of
Sèvres. The war also led to the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate. Nationalist revolts also occurred in Ireland
(1919–1921) and Syria (1925–1927). Under Mussolini, Italy pursued a more aggressive domestic and foreign policy,
leading to the nigh-eradication of the Sicilian Mafia and the Second Italo-Senussi War in Libya respectively. In
1927, China erupted into a civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China
(ROC) and forces of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Civil wars also occurred in Paraguay (1922–1923),
Ireland (1922–1923), Honduras (1924), Nicaragua (1926–1927), and Afghanistan (1928–1929). Saudi forces
conquered Jabal Shammar and subsequently, Hejaz.
A severe famine occurred in Russia (1921–1922) due to the combined effects of economic disturbance because of
the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, exacerbated by rail systems that could not distribute food
efficiently, leading to 5 million deaths. Another severe famine occurred in China (1928–1930), leading to 6 million
deaths. The Spanish flu pandemic (1918–1920) and Russian typhus epidemic (1918–1922), which had begun in the

previous decade, caused 25–50 million and 2–3 million deaths respectively. Major natural disasters of this decade
include the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake (258,707~273,407 deaths), 1922 Shantou typhoon (50,000–100,000 deaths),
1923 Great Kantō earthquake (105,385–142,800 deaths), and 1927 Gulang earthquake (40,912 deaths).
Silent films were popular in this decade, with the highest-grossing film of this decade being either the American
silent epic adventure-drama film Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ or the American silent war drama film The Big
Parade, depending on the metrics used. Sinclair Lewis was a popular author in the United States in the 1920s, with
his books Main Street and Elmer Gantry becoming best-sellers. Best-selling books outside the US included the
Czech book The Good Soldier Švejk, which sold 20 million copies. Songs of this decade included "Mack the Knife"
and "Tiptoe Through the Tulips".
During the 1920s, the world population increased from 1.87 to 2.05 billion, with approximately 700 million births
and 525 million deaths in total.

Social history
The Roaring Twenties brought about several novel and highly visible social and cultural trends. These trends, made
possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like New York, Chicago, Paris, Berlin,
and London. "Normalcy" returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during World War I, jazz
blossomed, and Art Deco peaked. For women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did
bobbed hair with a finger wave or marcel wave. The women who pioneered these trends were frequently referred to
as flappers.[2]
The era saw the large-scale adoption of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and household electricity, as
well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in
lifestyle and culture, mostly in the urbanized areas of the Western World. The media began to focus on celebrities,
especially sports heroes and movie stars. Large baseball stadiums were built in major US cities, in addition to
palatial cinemas.
Most independent countries passed women's suffrage after 1918, especially as a reward for women's support of the
war effort and endurance of its deaths and hardships.

throughout the 1920s. Prohibition was finally repealed in
1933. Organized crime turns to smuggling and bootlegging of
liquor, led by figures such as Al Capone, boss of the Chicago
Prohibition agents emptying barrels of
Outfit.

The Immigration Act of 1924 places restrictions on
immigration. National quotas curbed most Eastern and
Southern European nationalities, further enforced the ban on immigration of East Asians, South
Asians, and Southeast Asians, and put mild regulations on nationalities from the Western Hemisphere
(Latin Americans).
The major sport was baseball and the most famous player was Babe Ruth.

Treaty, which creates Vatican City. The Fascist regime pursues an
aggressive expansionist agenda in Europe such as by raiding
the Greek island of Corfu in 1923, pressuring Albania to
submit to becoming a de facto Italian protectorate in the mid1920s, and holding territorial aims on the region of Dalmatia in
Yugoslavia.

Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno to keep paying the World War I
during the March on Rome in 1922
reparations. The recently formed fringe National Socialist
German Workers' Party (a.k.a. Nazi Party) led by Adolf Hitler

Germany in order to help stabilize its economy and make war
reparations payments, was enacted in 1924.

as a whole, killed 751.
The tornado, was the deadliest in history, until 1989, where a F3 tornado hit Bangladesh, killing
1300. However, The Tri-State Tornado is still the 2nd deadliest in history, and the deadliest in the
United States.

station to receive a commercial license is WBZ, then in Springfield MA, in mid-September 1921. While
there are only a few radio stations in 1920–21, by 1922 the radio craze is sweeping the country.

Way Down East: p. 52 (https://books.google.com/books?id=zospQ7o5u0oC&pg=PA52). "D.W.
Griffith's Way Down East (1920) was projected to return rentals of $4,000,000 on an $800,000
negative. This figure was based on the amounts earned from its roadshow run, coupled with its
playoff in the rest of the country's theaters. Griffith had originally placed the potential film rental at
$3,000,000 but, because of the success of the various roadshows that were running the
$4,000,000 total was expected. The film showed a profit of $615,736 after just 23 weeks of

Cavalcade: p. 170 (https://books.google.com/books?id=zospQ7o5u0oC&pg=PA170). "The actual
cost of Cavalcade was $1,116,000 and it was most definitely not guaranteed a success. In fact, if
its foreign grosses followed the usual 40 percent of domestic returns, the film would have lost
money. In a turnaround, the foreign gross was almost double the $1,000,000 domestic take to
reach total world rentals of $3,000,000 and Fox's largest profit of the year at $664,000."
State Fair: p. 170 (https://books.google.com/books?id=zospQ7o5u0oC&pg=PA170). "State Fair
did turn out to be a substantial hit with the help of Janet Gaynor boosting Will Rogers back to the
level of money-making star. Its prestige engagements helped raked in a total $1,208,000 in
domestic rentals. Surprisingly, in foreign countries unfamiliar with state fairs, it still earned a
respectable $429,000. With its total rentals, the film ended up showing a $398,000 profit."
3. Hall & Neale 2010, p. 53 (https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro0hASPfC68C&pg=PA53). "The Four
Forsemen of the Apocalypse was to become Metro's most expensive production and one of the
decade's biggest box-office hits. Its production costs have been estimated at "something between
$600,000 and $800,000." Variety estimated its worldwide gross at $4 million in 1925 and at $5 million
in 1944; in 1991, it estimated its cumulative domestic rentals at $3,800,000."

prints were taken into account, Robin Hood cost about $1,400,000—exceeding both Intolerance
