1990s
The 1990s (often referred and shortened to as "the '90s" or "nineties") was the decade that
began on 1 January 1990, and ended on 31 December 1999. Known as the "post-Cold War
decade", the 1990s were culturally imagined as the period from the Revolutions of 1989 until
the September 11 attacks in 2001.[1] The dissolution of the Soviet Union marked the end of
Russia's status as a superpower, the end of a multipolar world, and the rise of anti-Western
sentiment. China was still recovering from a politically and economically turbulent period.[2]
This allowed the US to emerge as the world's sole superpower, creating relative peace and
prosperity for many western countries. During this decade, the world population grew from
5.3 to 6.1 billion.[3]
The decade saw greater attention to multiculturalism and advance of alternative media.
Public education about safe sex curbed HIV in developed countries. Generation X bonded
over musical tastes. Humor in television and film was marked by ironic self-references
mixed with popular culture references. Alternative music movements like grunge, reggaeton,
Eurodance, and hip-hop, became popular, aided by the rise in satellite and cable television,
and the internet. New music genres such as drum and bass, post-rock, happy hardcore,
denpa, and trance emerged. Video game popularity exploded due to the development of CDROM supported 3D computer graphics on platforms such as Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64,
and PCs.
The 1990s saw advances in technology, with the World Wide Web, evolution of the Pentium
microprocessor, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning.
The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990, building the Large Hadron Collider
commenced in 1998, and Nasdaq became the first US stock market to trade online.[4]
Environmentalism divided between left-wing green politics, primary industry-sponsored
environmentalist front organizations, and a more business-oriented approach to the
regulation of carbon footprint of businesses. More businesses started using information
technology.

There was a realignment and consolidation of economic and political power, such as the
continued mass-mobilization of capital markets through neoliberalism, globalization, and end of the Cold War. Network cultures were enhanced
by the proliferation of new media such as the internet, and a new ability to self-publish web pages and make connections on professional, political
and hobby topics. The digital divide was immediate, with access limited to those who could afford it and knew how to operate a computer. The
internet provided anonymity for individuals skeptical of the government. Traditional mass media continued to perform strongly. However,
mainstream internet users were optimistic about its benefits particularly the future of e-commerce. Web portals, a curated bookmark homepage,
were as popular as searching via web crawlers. The dot-com bubble of 1997–2000 brought wealth to some entrepreneurs before its crash of the
early-2000s.
Many countries were economically prosperous and spreading globalization. High-income countries experienced steady growth during the Great
Moderation (1980s—2000s). Using a mobile phone in a public place was typical conspicuous consumption. In contrast, the GDP of former Soviet
Union states declined as a result of neoliberal restructuring. International trade increased with the establishment of the European Union (EU) in
1993, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, and World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The Asia-Pacific economies of
the Four Asian Tigers, ASEAN, Australia and Japan were hampered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and early 1990s recession.

Major wars that began include the First and Second Congo Wars, the Rwandan Civil War and genocide, the Somali Civil War, and Sierra Leone
Civil War in Africa; the Yugoslav Wars in Southeast Europe; the First and Second Chechen Wars, in the former Soviet Union; and the Gulf War in
the Middle East. The Afghanistan conflict (1978–present) and Colombian conflict continued. The Oslo Accords seemed to herald an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but this was in vain. However, in Northern Ireland, The Troubles came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday
Agreement, ending 30 years of violence.[5]

Politics and wars

International wars
The Congo Wars began in the 1990s.[6]
The First Congo War (24 October 1996 – 16 May 1997) resulted in the overthrow of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, his 32 rule
of Zaire, which was then renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Second Congo War (August 1998 – July 2003) started in Central Africa and involved multiple nearby nations.
The Gulf War (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991).
Iraq was left in severe debt after the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s. President Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of flooding the
oil market, therefore driving down prices. As a result, Iraqi forces invaded and conquered Kuwait.
The UN (United Nations) immediately condemned the action and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the
Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991, and one month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from
Kuwait in four days.
Two wars were fought in the region of Chechnya:
The First Chechen War (1994–1996) was a conflict between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.
After the initial campaign of 1994–1995, culminating in the devastating Battle of Grozny, Russian federal forces attempted to
seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya. Despite Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and air support,
they were set back by Chechen guerrillas and raids on the flatlands. The resulting widespread demoralization of Russian
federal forces, and the universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led Boris Yeltsin's government to declare a
ceasefire in 1996 and sign a peace treaty a year later.
The Second Chechen War (1999 – 2009) was started by the Russian Federation in response to the 1999 invasion of
Dagestan and the Russian apartment bombings, which were blamed on the Chechens. In this military campaign, Russian
forces largely recaptured the separatist region of Chechnya and the outcome of the First Chechen War – in which the region
gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria – was essentially reversed.
The Eritrean–Ethiopian War (1998–2000) was commenced by the invasion of Ethiopia by Eritrea due to a territorial dispute.[7]
The conflict resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides[8] and a peace agreement in December 2000.[9]
The Kargil War (1999) began in May when Pakistan covertly sent troops to occupy strategic peaks in Kashmir. A month later, the
Kargil War with India resulted in a political fiasco for Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, followed by a Pakistani military
withdrawal to the Line of Control. The incident led to a Pakistani military coup in October, in which Sharif was ousted by Army
Chief Pervez Musharraf. This conflict remains the only war fought between the two declared nuclear powers.
The Yugoslav Wars (1991–1995) followed the breakup of Yugoslavia, beginning on 25 June 1991, after the republics of Croatia
and Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia. These wars were notorious for war crimes and human rights violations,
including ethnic cleansing and genocide, with the overwhelming majority of casualties being Muslim Bosniaks.
The Ten-Day War (1991) was a brief military conflict between Slovenian TO (Slovenian Territorial Defence) and the Yugoslav
People's Army ("JNA") following Slovenia's declaration of independence.

The Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995) was fought in modern-day Croatia between the
Croatian government (having declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia) and both the Yugoslav People's Army ("JNA") and Serb forces, who established the
self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina ("RSK") within Croatia.
The Bosnian War (1992–1995) involved several ethnically-defined factions within Bosnia and
Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, as well as a smaller Bosniak faction led by Fikret Abdić.
The Siege of Sarajevo (1992–1995) marked the most violent urban warfare in Europe since World
War II at that time, as Serb forces bombarded and attacked Bosnian-controlled and populated
areas of the city. War crimes occurred, including ethnic cleansing and the destruction of civilian
property.
The final fighting in the Croatian and Bosnian wars ended in 1995 with the success of Croatian
military offensives against Serb forces. This led to the mass exodus of Serbs from Croatia, Serb
losses to Croat and Bosniak forces, and the signing of the Dayton Agreement, which internally
partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a Republika Srpska and a Bosniak-Croat Federation.
The Kosovo War (1998–1999) was a war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb
paramilitary forces in Kosovo. That conflict began in 1996 and escalated in 1998, with increasing
reports of atrocities.

In 1999, the NATO, led by the United States, launched air attacks against Yugoslavia (then composed of only Serbia and
Montenegro) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The
intervention lacked UN approval yet was justified by NATO based on accusations of war crimes committed by Yugoslav
military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups. Finally, after months of bombing, Yugoslavia conceded
to NATO's demands, and NATO forces (later UN peacekeeping forces) occupied Kosovo.
The South African Border War (1990) was a border war between Zambia, Angola, and Namibia that began in 1966 and ended in
1990.

Civil wars and guerrilla wars
The First Liberian Civil War occurred from 1989 until 1997 and led to the death of around
200,000 people.
The Ethiopian Civil War (1991) was an internal conflict that had been raging for over twenty
years. Its end coincided with the establishment of a coalition government of various factions.
The Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) was caused by a group of high-ranking army officers
canceling the first multi-party elections in Algeria.[10]
The Somali Civil War (1991–present) included the Battle of Mogadishu.
Rwandan genocide: Bones of
The Rwandan genocide (1994) occurred from 6 April to mid-July 1994 when hundreds of
genocide victims in Murambi
thousands of Rwanda's Tutsis and Hutu political moderates were killed by the HutuTechnical School. Estimates put the
dominated government under the Hutu Power ideology. For approximately 100 days between

under criticism for failing to stop the genocide.
1993 Russian constitutional crisis resulted from a severe political deadlock between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet (Russia's parliament at this time) resulting in Yeltsin ordering the controversial
shelling of the Russian parliament building by tanks.
The Tajikistani Civil War (1992–1997) occurred when the Tajikistan government was pitted against the United Tajik Opposition,
resulting in the death of between 50,000 and 100,000 people.
The Zapatista uprising (1994) occurred when a large number of the Zapatista indigenous people of Mexico formed the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation and began an armed conflict with the Mexican government to protest against NAFTA. The uprising
lasted 12 days, bringing worldwide attention to the Zapatistas, and continued through the rest of the 1990s.
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001) was formed at the end of the Afghan Civil War, when the Taliban seized control
of Afghanistan in 1996. They ruled during the later Afghan Civil War until their ousting 2001.
The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1998) involved 30 years of conflict that ended on 10 April 1998, when the Good Friday
Agreement was signed.
1999 East Timorese crisis.

Coups
Terrorist attacks
The 1993 World Trade Center bombing in the United States (1993) led to broader public awareness in the US of domestic
terrorism and international terrorism as a potential threat.
Markale market massacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994) – soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska deliberately targeted
Bosniak (then known as "Bosnian Muslims") civilians.
AMIA bombing (1994) – on 18 July 1994, an unknown terrorist targeting Argentina's Jewish community planted a car bomb in the
Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina headquarters in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds, making it the first
ethnically targeted bombing and deadliest bombing in Argentine history.
Srebrenica genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995) – soldiers of the Army of Republika Srpska and members of Serbia's
Scorpions paramilitary group committed mass murder of Bosniak civilians.
Oklahoma City bombing (1995) in the United States – the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma killed 168
people, becoming the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States at that time. Suspect Timothy McVeigh claimed he bombed

the building in retaliation for the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff and the Waco siege a year
later.[13]
The 1996 Manchester bombing (1996) – on 15 June 1996, the IRA set off a bomb in
Manchester, England. The bomb, placed in a van on Corporation Street in the city center,
targeted the city's infrastructure and economy and caused widespread damage, estimated by
insurers at £700 million (£1 billion as of 2011). Two hundred and twelve people were injured,
but there were no fatalities.
The 1998 United States embassy bombings – Al-Qaeda militants carried out bomb attacks on
United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In retaliation, U.S. naval military forces
launched cruise missile attacks against Al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan.
The Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland (1998) – a bombing in Omagh, County Tyrone, that
killed 29 civilians and injured hundreds more.
LAX bombing plot (1999) – Ahmed Ressam, an Islamist militant associated with Al-Qaeda,
was arrested when attempting to cross from Canada into the United States at the CanadaU.S. border on 14 December 1999. It was later discovered that he intended to bomb Los
Angeles International Airport (LAX) during millennium celebrations. This was the first major
attempted terrorist attack by Al-Qaeda on United States soil since the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing and marked the beginning of a series of attempted terrorist attacks by AlQaeda against the United States that would continue into the 21st century.

Political trends
The 1990s saw an increased spread of capitalism and third way policies.[14] The former countries of the Warsaw Pact moved
from single-party socialist states to multi-party states with private sector economies.[14] The same wave of political liberalization
occurred in the capitalist and newly industrialized countries (including First and Third World countries), such as Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Market reforms
made incredible changes to the economies of Second World socialist countries such as China and Vietnam.

Ethnic tensions and violence in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s created a greater sense of ethnic identity among nations in
newly independent countries and a marked increase in the popularity of nationalism.

Prominent political events
Africa
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela was released from prison on 11 February 1990, after
thirty years of imprisonment for opposing apartheid and white-minority rule in South Africa. Apartheid ended
in South Africa in 1994.[15]
Nelson Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, becoming the first democratically elected
president in South African history, and ending a long legacy of apartheid white rule in the country.[15]
Americas
The establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994, created a
North American free-trade zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
Canadian politics was radically altered in the 1993 federal election with the collapse of the Progressive
Conservative Party of Canada. A major political party in Canada since 1867, the party went from controlling
the government to being left with only two seats. The New Democratic Party collapsed as well, with their
sets declining from 44 to 9. The Liberal Party of Canada was the only genuinely 'national' political party left
standing. Regionally-based parties, such as the Quebec-based Bloc Québécois and the
almost entirely Western Canada-based Reform Party of Canada, rose from political
insignificance to being major political parties.
After the collapse of the Meech Lake constitutional accord in 1990, the province of Quebec in
Canada experienced a rekindled wave of separatism by Francophone Québécois
nationalists, who sought for Quebec to become an independent country and forced a
referendum on the question of independence in 1995.
The 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty was held in the predominantly francophone
province of Quebec in Canada, a majority Anglophone country. If accepted, Quebec
would have become an independent country with an economic association with Canada.
Quebec's voters narrowly rejected the proposal.

Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. This
impeachment attempt did not
succeed, and Clinton continued to
serve as president until the end of
his term in January 2001.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Haitian priest, became the first democratically elected
President of Haiti in 1990. A proponent of liberation theology, Aristide was appointed to a
Roman Catholic parish in Port-au-Prince in 1982 after completing his studies to become a
priest of the Salesian order. Aristide was later forced into exile in the Central African Republic
and South Africa and returned to Haiti after several years.
Ernesto Zedillo was elected President of Mexico in the 1994 presidential election, making him
the last of an uninterrupted 72-year-long succession of Mexican presidents from the dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The original PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio
Murrieta, was assassinated several months prior.
Due to internal conflict and an economic crisis, Alberto Fujimori rose to power in Peru and remained in office for eleven years.
His administration was marked by economic development but also by numerous human rights violations (La Cantuta massacre,
Barrios Altos massacre) and a rampant corruption network set up by Vladimiro Montesinos.
The sluggish Latin American economies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their
citizens after the debt crisis of the 1980s. Following democratic reforms and neoliberal policies were implemented by President
Carlos Saúl Menem (Argentina), President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (Chile), President Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico), and President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazil), in their best shape by the late 1990s.
United States President Bill Clinton was a dominant political figure in international affairs during the 1990s, known primarily for
his attempts to negotiate peace in the Middle East and end the ongoing wars occurring in the former Yugoslavia, his promotion of
international action to decrease human-created climate change, and his endorsement of advancing free trade in the Americas.
After a failed coup attempt in 1992, Hugo Chávez, politician and former member of the Venezuelan military, is elected President
of Venezuela in 1998.
Lewinsky scandal – US president Bill Clinton was caught in a media-frenzied scandal involving inappropriate relations with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, which was first announced on 21 January 1998. After the United States House of
Representatives impeached Bill Clinton on 19 December 1998, for perjury under oath, and following an investigation by federal
prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the Senate acquitted Clinton of all charges on 12 February 1999. He served out the remainder of his
second term.

at the culmination of the Oslo Accords, negotiated by the United States President, Bill Clinton, on 13 September 1993.

By signing the Oslo accords, the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized
Israel's right to exist. At the same time, Israel permitted the creation of an
autonomous Palestinian National Authority consisting of the Gaza Strip and West
Bank, which was implemented in 1994.
Israeli military forces withdrew from these Palestinian territories in compliance with
the accord, which marked the end of the First Intifada (a period of violence between
Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993).
The Palestinian National Authority was created in 1994 following the Oslo Accords,
giving Palestinian Arab people official autonomy over the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
though not official independence from Israel.

In July 1994, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died, having ruled the country since its
founding in 1948. His son Kim Jong Il, who succeeded him, took over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse.
Famine had caused a significant number of deaths in the late 1990s, and North Korea gained a reputation for being an important
hub of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons
became a prominent concern in the international community.
In 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in Burma won a majority of seats in the first free election conducted
in 30 years. But the SPDC refused to relinquish power, beginning a peaceful struggle that began in the 1990s and continued for
several decades, primarily fueled by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule.
Indonesian President Suharto resigned after ruling the country for 32 years (1966–1998), following the riots on several cities in

Japan saw eight different prime ministers serve during the 1990s in what was at first called the "Lost Decade" but later
became referred to as the "Lost Decades of the Heisei Era". These included Morihiro Hosokawa, who won the 1993
Japanese general election and formed an opposition coalition until 1996.
Europe
The improvement in relations between NATO countries and the former members of the Warsaw Pact led to the end of the Cold
War, both in Europe and other parts of the world.
German reunification – on 3 October 1990, East and West Germany reunified as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the fall of the Berlin Wall. After reintegrating their economic structure and provincial governments, Germany focused on the
modernization of the formerly communist East. People brought up in socialist East Germany became integrated with those living
in capitalist West Germany.
Margaret Thatcher, who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November
1990 after being challenged for leadership of the Conservative Party by Michael Heseltine. This was because of widespread
opposition to the introduction of the controversial Community Charge, and the fact that her key allies such as Nigel Lawson and
Geoffrey Howe resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the Maastricht Treaty and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain
joining the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Less than two years later, on the infamous Black Wednesday of September
1992, the pound sterling crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the Deutsche Mark.
John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990.
The Perestroika (restructuring) of the Soviet Union destabilized, leading to nationalist and separatist demagogues gaining
popularity. Boris Yeltsin, then chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, resigned from the Communist Party and became the
opposition leader against Mikhail Gorbachev. The Communist Party lost its status as the governing force of the country and was
banned after a coup attempt by communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counterrevolution was victorious, and on 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned from the presidency, which led to the dissolution of
the Soviet Union. Yeltsin became president of the Soviet Union's successor, the Russian Federation, and presided over a period
of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned, leaving Vladimir Putin as acting
president.
The European Union was formed in 1992 under the Maastricht Treaty.
The Downing Street Declaration, signed on 15 December 1993 by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, John Major, and
the Taoiseach of Ireland, Albert Reynolds at the British Prime Minister's office in 10 Downing Street, affirmed that (1) the right of
the people of Ireland to self-determination, and (2) that Northern Ireland would be transferred to the Republic of Ireland from the
United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the perspective of the socalled "Irish dimension," the principle of consent that the people of the island of Ireland had the exclusive right to solve the issues
between North and South by mutual consent.[16][17] The latter statement, which later would become one of the points of the

Good Friday Agreement,[18] was key to producing a positive change of attitude by the Republicans towards a negotiated
settlement. The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement and promised that
parties linked with paramilitaries (such as Sinn Féin) could take part in the talks so long as they abandoned violence.[19]
The IRA agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United
Kingdom and the start of political negotiations.
Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 following a general election.
The Belfast Agreement (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) was signed by the U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998,
declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom over
Northern Ireland. The 1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum was held on 22 May 1998, with majority
approval.[20]
The National Assembly for Wales was established following the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, in which a majority of voters
approved the creation of the National Assembly for Wales.[21]
In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favor
of the establishment of a new Scottish Parliament.[22][23]

Disasters
Natural disasters
The 1990s saw a trend in frequent and more devastating natural disasters, breaking many previous records. Although the
1990s was designated by the United Nations as an International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction as part of its
program to prevent losses due to disasters, disasters would go on to cause a record-breaking US$608 billion worth of
damage—more than the past four decades combined.[38]

The most prominent natural disasters of the decade include: Hurricane Andrew striking South Florida in
August 1992, the crippling super storm of March 1993 along the Eastern Seaboard, the devastating 1994
Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles, the Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan in January 1995, the Blizzard of 1996 in
the eastern United States, the US drought of 1999, the deadly Hurricane Mitch which struck Central America in October 1998,
the destructive Oklahoma tornado outbreak in May 1999, the August 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, and the September 1999
Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan.
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit the Philippines on 16 July 1990 and killed around 1000 people in Baguio.

National Weather Service in history.
In December 1999, torrential rains and flash floods killed tens of thousands of Venezuelans
living in the state of Vargas in a natural disaster known as the Vargas tragedy.

Economics
Many countries, institutions, companies, and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s. High-income countries such as the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Western Europe experienced steady economic growth
for much of the decade during the Great Moderation. However, in the former Soviet Union, GDP decreased as their economies restructured to
produce goods they needed, and some capital flight occurred.
In 1993, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was updated to include the creation of the World Trade
Organization, with the 76 existing GATT members and European Communities becoming the founding members of the World

Trade Organization on 1 January 1995. Opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in
nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in Seattle in December 1999.
The anti-globalization protests in the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 in
Seattle began on 30 November 1999. This marked the beginning of a steady increase in antiglobalization protests in the first decade of the 21st century and increasing hostility to
neoliberalism.

The G20 or Group of Twenty formed on 26 September 1999.
North America

The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United
States and Canada, largely because of the unexpected
advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries. The US and Canadian
economies experienced their longest period of peacetime economic expansion, beginning in
1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher
productivity overall. The New York Stock Exchange stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999
to 2001.
After the 1992 boom of the US stock market, Alan Greenspan coined the phrase "irrational
exuberance", a reference to the overenthusiasm of investors that typified the trading of this
period, and warned of overvaluation of assets and the stock market generally.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which phases out the trade barriers
between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, was signed into law by President Bill
Clinton.

Asia
In the People's Republic of China, the government announced the major privatization of
state-owned industries in September 1997. China entered the 1990s in a turbulent period
due to the aftermath of both the Tiananmen Square Massacre and hardline politicians'
efforts to rein in private enterprise and attempt to revive old-fashioned propaganda
campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese
leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992
Deng Xiaoping travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize
faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into Maoism. Afterward, China

recovered and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade.
Despite this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and Communist Party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin launched a brutal crackdown against the Falun Gong religious sect in 1999.
Deng Xiaoping died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese
embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the
Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.
Financial crisis hits East and Southeast Asian countries between 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic
development, which continues into 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.
In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the county experienced an
economic downturn after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, ending the seemingly
unlimited prosperity that the country had previously enjoyed.
Less affluent nations such as India, Malaysia, and Vietnam also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and
quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the
continuation of terrorism in Third World regions that were once the "frontlines" for American and Soviet foreign politics,
particularly in Asia.
Europe
By 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms were causing major inflation and
economic chaos. A coup attempt by hardliners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective
end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence by 1991,
and Gorbachev resigned from office on Christmas. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had
ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by Boris Yeltsin, and would face
severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors,
reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the

ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, Yeltsin stepped down from office on the

Russian financial crisis in the 1990s resulted in mass hyperinflation and prompted economic intervention from the International
Monetary Fund and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.
The first McDonald's restaurant opened in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and
future Russian President Boris Yeltsin attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist free market economy and a
move towards adopting elements of Western culture.
Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and broader adoption of
trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by
increased oil production. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the Cold War led to economic
development and higher living standards for many citizens.

Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the 1990s. However, problems including
the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties
associated with German reunification led to sluggish growth in these countries. However, the
French and German economies improved in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the
economies of Spain, Scandinavia and former Eastern Bloc countries accelerated at rapid
speed during the decade. Unemployment rates were low due to many having experienced a
deep recession at the start of the decade.
After the early 1990s recession, the United Kingdom and Ireland experienced rapid economic

would continue until the Great Recession, marking the longest uninterrupted period of
economic growth in history.
Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania saw economic growth in the late 1990s.
With the creation of the European Union (EU), there is freedom of movement between member states, such as the 1992 and
1995 free trade agreements.
The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out the former national
currencies of EU countries.[40]
South America
A Latin American common market, Mercosur, was established in 1991. Mercosur's origins are linked to the discussions for the
constitution of a regional economic market for Latin America, which go back to the treaty that established the Latin American
Free Trade Association in 1960, which was succeeded by the Latin American Integration Association in the 1980s.

Science and technology
Technology
The 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology. Between 1990 and 1997, household PC
ownership in the US rose from 15% to 35%.[42] Cell phones of the early-1990s and earlier ones were very
large, lacked extra features, and were used by only a few percent of the population of even the advanced
nations. Only a few million people used online services in 1990, and the World Wide Web, which would
have a significant impact on technology for many decades, had only just been invented. The first web
browser went online in 1993.[43] By 2001, more than 50% of some Western countries had Internet access,
and more than 25% had cell phone access.
Electronics and communications

Y2K spread fear throughout the United States and eventually the world in the last half of the
decade, particularly in 1999, about possible massive computer malfunctions on 1 January
2000. As a result, many people stocked up on supplies for fear of a worldwide disaster. After
significant effort to upgrade systems on the part of software engineers, no failures occurred when the
clocks rolled over into 2000.
Advancements in computer modems, ISDN, cable modems, and DSL led to faster connections to the

solidified with CNN's coverage of Desert Storm and Desert Shield. Though CNN had been running 24-hour newscasts since
1980, it was not until the Gulf War that the general public took notice, and others imitated CNN's non-stop news approach.[47]
Portable CD players, introduced during the late 1980s, became very popular and profoundly impacted the music industry and
youth culture during the 1990s.

Rail transportation
The opening of the Channel Tunnel between France and the United Kingdom saw the commencement by the three national railway companies of
Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, respectively SNCB/NMBS, SNCF and British Rail of the joint Eurostar service.
On 14 November 1994 Eurostar services began between Waterloo
International station in London, Gare du Nord in Paris and Brussels
South in Brussels.[48][49][50] In 1995 Eurostar was achieving an
average end-to-end speed of 171.5 km/h (106.6 mph) between London
and Paris.[51] On 8 January 1996 Eurostar launched services from a
second railway station in the UK when Ashford International was
opened.[52] Journey times between London and Brussels were reduced
by the opening of the High Speed 1 line on 14 December 1997.

The 1990s began with a recession that dampened car sales. General Motors suffered huge losses because of
an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new Saturn division fared
well, Oldsmobile fell sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.
Cars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and
to a lesser extent later on.

Chrysler ran into financial troubles as it entered the 1990s. Like GM, the Chrysler too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling
minivans) that were largely based on the aging K-car platform. In 1992, chairman Lee Iacocca retired, and the company began a remarkable
revival, introducing the new LH platform and "Cab-Forward" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized Dodge Ram in
1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, Daimler-Benz (the parent company of
Mercedes-Benz) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire Plymouth, which had been on a long decline since the 1970s.
Ford continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the second and third generations of the Ford Taurus being named the best-selling car in the United
States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the Toyota Camry starting in 1997, which became the bestselling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, with the first model being
sold in 1991. Ford's Explorer became the best-selling SUV on the market, outselling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee.
Japanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The Honda Accord vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling
car in the United States during the early decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands Lexus and Infiniti began car sales of 1990 model
year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991 and outsell Cadillac
and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the decade's second half. Many
manufacturers that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Fabrication during the 1990s became gradually rounder and ovoid, the
Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as airbags and shoulder belts became mandatory
equipment on new cars.

Society
The 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would
continue until the Great Recession of the late 2000s/early 2010s.
Youth culture in the 1990s responded to this by embracing both environmentalism and entrepreneurship. Fashion of the Western
world reflected this by often turning highly individualistic and/or counter-cultural, which was influenced by Generation X and early
millennials: tattoos and body piercings gained popularity, and "retro" styles, inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s, were
also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in extreme sports and outdoor activities that combined
embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.
In 1990 the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its list of diseases.[54] Increasing acceptance of openly
homosexual people occurred in the western world, slowly starting in the early 1990s,[55] Biphobia towards bisexual men became
somewhat fashionable amongst heterosexual women and gay men, while lesbians and bisexual women complained of being
commodified by publishing and film industries to cater to heterosexual men.
Following the murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer by a stalker, America's first anti-stalking laws, including California Penal

Environment
At the beginning of the decade, sustainable development and environmental protection became serious
issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the Brundtland Report
by the United Nations paved the way to establish an environmental governance. In 1992, the Earth Summit
was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries committed to protect the environment, signing a
Convention on Biological Diversity.

The prevention of the destruction of the tropical rainforests of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern
in the early 1990s and has continued and accelerated in its prominence.
The Chernobyl disaster had significant impact on public opinion at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into
the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.[56] Well into the 1990s, several environmental NGOs helped improve environmental awareness
among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was Greenpeace, which did not hesitate to
lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drew attention to the large deforestation of the Amazon
rainforest during the period.
Global warming as an aspect of climate change also became a major concern, and the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the

PlayStation. Spyro The Dragon, released on 9 September 1998, also became a successful platforming series. Tomb Raider 's Lara Croft became a

the time it was released. It is credited with defining the survival horror genre and with returning zombies to popular culture, leading to a renewed
interest in zombie films by the 2000s.
Video game genres

copy this trend by the end of the decade. The most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are GoldenEye 007 and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.
The violent nature of fighting games like Capcom's Street Fighter II, Sega's Virtua Fighter, and Midway's Mortal Kombat prompted the video
game industry to accept a game rating system. Hundreds of knockoffs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. Doom (1993) bursts onto the
world scene, and instantly popularizes the FPS genre. Half-Life (1998) builds upon this, using gameplay without levels and an immersive firstperson perspective. Half-Life became one of the most popular FPS games in history.

popular multiplayer RTS games today, especially in South Korea. Homeworld in 1999 becomes the first successful 3D RTS game. The rise of the

introduced (in North America) in 1990 for the NES and remains among the most popular video game franchises, with many new titles to date and
more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. Final Fantasy VII, released in 1997, especially popularized the
series.

it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as IRC and USENET), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on
sharing MP3 files for music. Napster was eventually forced to shut down in July 2001 after legal disputes over copyright infringement and digital
piracy, though it would eventually be relaunched as a music streaming service in 2016.
