1910s

The 1910s (pronounced "nineteen-tens" often shortened to
the "'10s" or the "Tens") was the decade that began on
January 1, 1910, and ended on December 31, 1919.

The 1910s represented the culmination of European
militarism which had its beginnings during the second half
of the 19th century. The conservative lifestyles during the
first half of the decade, as well as the legacy of military
alliances, were forever changed by the June 28, 1914
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir
presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. The
archduke's murder triggered a chain of events in which,
within 33 days, World War I broke out in Europe on August
1, 1914. The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared
on November 11, 1918, leading to the controversial and
one-sided Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919.

The decade was also a period of revolution in many countries. The Portuguese 5 October 1910 revolution, which
ended the eight-century-long monarchy, spearheaded the trend, followed by the Mexican Revolution in November
1910, which led to the ousting of dictator Porfirio Diaz, developing into a violent civil war that dragged on until
mid-1920, not long after a new Mexican Constitution was signed and ratified. The Russian Empire had a similar
fate, since its participation in World War I led it to a social, political, and economical collapse which made the tsarist
autocracy unsustainable and, succeeding the events of 1905, culminated in the Russian Revolution and the
establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, under the direction of the Bolshevik Party, later
renamed as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution of 1918, known as the October
Revolution, was followed by the Russian Civil War, which dragged on until approximately late 1922. China saw
2,000 years of imperial rule ended with the Xinhai Revolution, becoming a nominal republic until Yuan Shikai's
failed attempt to restore the monarchy and his death started the Warlord Era in 1916.

Much of the music in these years was ballroom-themed. Many of the fashionable restaurants were equipped with
dance floors. Prohibition in the United States began January 16, 1919, with the ratification of the Eighteenth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Best-selling books of this decade include The Inside of the Cup, Seventeen,
Mr. Britling Sees It Through, and The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
During the 1910s, the world population increased from 1.75 to 1.87 billion,
with approximately 640 million births and 500 million deaths in total.

Diaz. The revolution led to the ousting of Diaz (who ruled from 1876 to 1880 and since 1884) six
months later. The revolution progressively became a civil war with multiple factions and phases,
culminating with the Mexican Constitution of 1917, but combat would persist for three more years.
