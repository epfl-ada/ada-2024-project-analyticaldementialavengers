1950s
The 1950s (pronounced nineteen-fifties; commonly

abbreviated as the "Fifties" or the "'50s") (among other

variants) was a decade that began on January 1, 1950, and
ended on December 31, 1959.

Throughout the decade, the world continued its recovery
from World War II, aided by the post-World War II
economic expansion. The period also saw great population
growth with increased birth rates and the emergence of the
baby boomer generation. Despite this recovery, the Cold
War developed from its modest beginnings in the late 1940s
to a heated competition between the Soviet Union and the
United States by the early 1960s. The ideological clash
between communism and capitalism dominated the decade,
especially in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the United States, a wave of anti-communist sentiment
known as the Second Red Scare aka McCarthyism resulted
in Congressional hearings by both houses in Congress. In
the Soviet Union, the death of Joseph Stalin would lead to a
political campaign and reforms known as "de-Stalinization"
initiated by Nikita Khrushchev leading to the deterioration
between the relationship of the Soviet Union and China in
the 1950s.

The beginning of the Cold War led to the beginning of the
Space Race with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957; the
United States would create NASA in response in 1958.
Along with increased testing of nuclear weapons (such as
RDS-37 and Upshot—Knothole) called the arms race, the
tense geopolitical situation created a politically conservative
climate.

The beginning of decolonization in Africa and Asia also
took place in this decade and accelerated in the following
decade albeit would lead to several conflicts throughout the
decade and so on. Wars include the First Indochina War,

Revolution, and the Suez Crisis. Coups include the Egyptian Revolution, the Iranian coup d'état, the Guatemalan
coup d'état, the 14 July Revolution in Iraq, and the Pakistani coup d'état in 1958.

Television became a common innovation in American homes during the 1950s culminating in the Golden Age of
TV. This led many to purchase more products and upgrade whatever they currently had resulting in mass

consumerism. While outside of America, it would take a few decades for TV to become commonplace in other

countries.

The 1950s saw a turning point for polio with the successful discovery of the polio vaccine. Following the
widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many
industrialized countries while it would gradually decline for the next few decades in developing countries reducing
the number of death rates from this disease.

During the 1950s, the world population increased from 2.5 to 3.0 billion, with approximately 1 billion births and
500 million deaths.

=» Korean War (1950-1953) — The war, which lasted from June 25,
1950, until the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July
27, 1953, started as a civil war between North Korea and the
Republic of Korea (South Korea). When it began, North and South
Korea existed as provisional governments competing for control
over the Korean peninsula, due to the division of Korea by outside
powers. While originally a civil war, it quickly escalated into a war
between the Western powers under the United Nations Command
led by the United States and its allies and the communist powers of
the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

On September 15, General Douglas MacArthur conducted

Operation Chromite, an amphibious landing at the city of Inchon

(Song Do port). The North Korean army collapsed, and within a few

days, MacArthur's army retook Seoul (South Korea's capital). He Korean War

then pushed north, capturing Pyongyang in October. Chinese

intervention the following month drove UN forces south again.

MacArthur then planned for a full-scale invasion of China, but this was against the wishes of
President Truman and others who wanted a limited war. He was dismissed and replaced by
General Matthew Ridgway. The war then became a bloody stalemate for the next two and a half
years while peace negotiations dragged on.
The war left 33,742 American soldiers dead, 92,134 wounded, and 80,000 missing in action (MIA)
or prisoner of war (POW). Estimates place Korean and Chinese casualties at 1,000,000—
1,400,000 dead or wounded, and 140,000 MIA or POW.

« First Indochina War (1946-1954).

= The Vietnam War began in 1955. Diém instituted a policy of death penalty against any communist
activity in 1956. The Viet Minh began an assassination campaign in early 1957. An article by
French scholar Bernard Fall published in July 1958 concluded that a new war had begun. The first
official large unit military action was on September 26, 1959, when the Viet Cong ambushed two
ARVN companies.!4]

Arab-Israeli conflict (from the early 20th century)

Suez Crisis (1956) — The Suez Crisis was a war fought on
Egyptian territory in 1956. Following the nationalisation of the
Suez Canal in 1956 by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the United
Kingdom, France and Israel subsequently invaded. The
operation was a military success, but after the United States and
Soviet Union united in opposition to the invasion, the invaders
were forced to withdraw. This was seen as a major humiliation,
especially for the two Western European countries, and
symbolizes the beginning of the end of colonialism and the
weakening of European global importance, specifically the
collapse of the British Empire.

Algerian War (1954-1962) — An important decolonization war, it

was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare, maquis

fighting, terrorism against civilians, use of torture on both sides and counter-terrorism operations by
the French Army. The war eventually led to the independence of Algeria from France.

Internal conflicts

Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) — a guerrilla war in British Malaya
that led to the independence of the Federation of Malaya.

Cuban Revolution (1953-1959) — The 1959 overthrow of Fulgencio
Batista by Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and other forces resulted in
the creation of the first communist government in the Western
hemisphere.

The Mau Mau began retaliating against the British in Kenya. This led
to concentration camps in Kenya, a British military victory, and the
election of moderate nationalist Jomo Kenyatta as leader of Kenya.
First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972)

The Wind of Destruction began in Rwanda in 1959 following the
assault of Hutu politician Dominique Mbonyumutwa by Tutsi forces.
This was the beginning of decades of ethnic violence in the country,
which culminated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Hungarian Revolution of 1956 — A massive, spontaneous popular Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.

Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist regime, inspired by political changes Cuba asa result of the Cuban
in Poland and the Soviet Union. The uprising, fought primarily by Revolution

students and workers, managed to fight the invading Soviet Army toa

standstill, and a new, pro-reform government took power. While the

top Soviet leaders even considered withdrawing from Hungary entirely, they soon crushed the
Revolution with a massive second invasion, killing thousands of Hungarians and sending hundreds of
thousands more into exile. This was the largest act of internal dissent in the history of the Soviet Bloc,
and its violent suppression served to further discredit the Soviet Union even among its erstwhile
supporters.

Decolonization and independence

= Decolonization of former European colonial empires. The French
Fourth Republic in particular faced conflict on two fronts within the
French Union, the Algerian War and the First Indochina War. The
Federation of Malaya peacefully gained independence from the
United Kingdom in 1957. French rule ended in Algeria in 1958,
Vietnam left French Indochina in 1954. The rival states of North
Vietnam and South Vietnam were formed. Cambodia and the
Kingdom of Laos also gained independence, effectively ending
French presence in Southeast Asia. Elsewhere, the Belgian
Congo and other African nations gained their independence from
France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.

= Large-scale decolonization in Africa first began in the 1950s. In 1951, Libya became the first African
country to gain independence in the decade, and in 1954 the Algerian War began. 1956 saw Sudan,
Morocco, and Tunisia become independent, and the next year Ghana became the first sub-saharan
African nation to gain independence.

=» European Common Market — The European Communities (or Common Markets), the precursor of the
European Union, was established with the Treaty of Rome in 1957.

=» On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists staged an attempted assassination on U.S.
President Harry S. Truman. The leader of the team Griselio Torresola had firearm experience and
Oscar Collazo was his accomplice. They made their assault at the Blair House where President
Truman and his family were staying. Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, Leslie
Coffelt, who shot Torresola dead before expiring himself. Collazo, as a co-conspirator in a felony that
turned into a homicide, was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death in 1952 but then his
sentence was later commuted to life in prison.

= On July 7, 1950, the first Group Areas Act was promulgated by the Parliament of South Africa and
implemented over a period of several years. The passing of the Act contributed significantly to the
period of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa known as Apartheid,
which lasted from 1948 to 1991. One of the most famous uses of the Group Areas Act was the
destruction of Sophiatown, a suburb of Johannesburg, which began on 9 February 1955.

= Establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement, through the Bandung Conference of 1955, consisting of
nations not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc.

Asia

economically.

= Within a year of its establishment, the People's Republic of China
had reclaimed Tibet and intervened in the Korean War, causing
years of hostility and estrangement from the United States. Mao
admired Stalin and rejected the changes in Moscow after Stalin's
death in 1953, leading to growing tension with the Soviet Union.

= In 1950-1953, France tried to contain a growing communist

insurgency led by Ho Chi Minh. After their defeat in the Battle of The maximum territorial extent of
Dien Bien Phu in 1954 France granted independence to the countries in the world under Soviet
nations of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. At the Geneva influence, after the Cuban
Conference of 1954 France and the Communists agreed to divide Revolution,

Vietnam and hold elections in 1956. The U.S. and South Vietnam
rejected the Geneva accords and the division became permanent.

= The Chinese Civil War, which had started officially in 1927 and continued until the Second World War
had ended on May 7, 1950. It resulted in the previous incumbent government in China, the Republic
of China, retreating to the islands of Taiwan and Hainan until the Landing Operation on Hainan Island.

Africa

= Africa experienced the beginning of large-scale top-down economic interventions in the 1950s that
failed to cause improvement and led to charitable exhaustion by the West as the century went on. The
widespread corruption was not dealt with and war, disease, and famine continued to be constant
problems in the region.

= Egyptian general Gamel Abdel Nasser overthrew the Egyptian monarchy, establishing himself as
President of Egypt. Nasser became an influential leader in the Middle East in the 1950s, leading Arab
states into war with Israel, becoming a major leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and promoting
pan-Arab unification.

= In 1957, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, after a series of negotiations with the then British empire, secured the
independence of Ghana. Ghana was hitherto referred to as Gold Coast, a colony of the British
Empire.

Americas

= In 1950, Greenland (27 May) became a Colony of the Kingdom of Denmark. North Greenland and
South Greenland were united with one governor./2]

= In 1954, the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz and
installed Carlos Castillo Armas.

= In 1956, the Montgomery bus boycott occurred against the policy of racial segregation on the public
transit system of Montgomery, Alabama, US. It was a foundational event in the civil rights movement,
sparked by activist Rosa Parks, and officially ended when the federal ruling Browder v. Gayle took
effect and led to a Supreme Court decision that declared the
Alabama laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional.)

= In 1957, Dr. Francois Duvalier came to power in an election in
Haiti. He later declared himself president for life, and ruled until his
death in 1971.

Eisenhower, president of the United

States for a majority of the 1950s

Europe

= With the help of the Marshall Plan, post-war reconstruction succeeded, with some countries (including
West Germany) adopting free market capitalism while others adopted Keynesian-policy welfare
states. Europe continued to be divided into Western and Soviet bioc countries. The geographical point
of this division came to be called the Iron Curtain.

= Because previous attempts for a unified state failed, Germany remained divided into two states: the
capitalist Federal Republic of Germany in the west and the socialist German Democratic Republic in
the east. The Federal Republic identified itself as the legal successor to the fascist dictatorship and
was obliged in paying war reparations. The GDR, however, denounced the fascist past completely
and did not recognize itself as responsible for paying reparations on behalf of the Nazi regime. The
GDR's more harsh attitude in suppressing anti-communist and Russophobic sentiment lingering in the
post-Nazi society resulted in increased emigration to the west.

= While the United States military maintained its bases in western Europe, the Soviet Union maintained
its bases in the east. In 1953, Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, died. This led to the rise
of Nikita Khrushchev, who denounced Stalin and pursued a more liberal domestic and foreign policy,
stressing peaceful competition with the West rather than overt hostility. There were anti-Stalinist
uprisings in East Germany and Poland in 1953 and Hungary in 1956.

= The Coronation of Elizabeth II took place on June 2, 1953, months after the death of her father King
George VI. Elizabeth Il was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms

Ireland, killing all 99 people aboard.

Economics

= The United States was the most influential economic power in the world after World War II under the
presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In the 1950s, the median age of newlyweds declined to its lowest point, a level not seen since. By 1954, nearly
half of American brides were teenagers, often marrying men just a few years older. These brides sought husbands
who were stable providers. A strong economy and low unemployment rates supported widespread prosperity,
expanding the middle class and making affordable housing accessible. This economic environment enabled young
couples to marry early, granting teenage brides notable purchasing power that marketers actively targeted. [6]

During this period, a gap in educational attainment emerged, with college degrees yielding higher earning potential
than high school diplomas.!/! Given prevailing cultural norms, more men pursued higher education while their
wives contributed financially by entering the workforce. Recognizing this support, some schools even awarded the
“PhT” (Putting Husband Through) diploma to acknowledge wives who helped their husbands complete their

degrees, 8

Credit cards gained widespread popularity in the 1950's starting with the Diners Club Card in New York and soon

after expanded to multiple countries. [9]
Inflation was moderate during the decade of the 1950s. The first few months had a deflationary hangover from the
1940s but the first full year ended with what looked like the beginnings of massive inflation with annual inflation
rates ranging from 8% to 9% a year. By 1952 inflation subsided. 1954 and 1955 flirted with deflation again but the
remainder of the decade had moderate inflation ranging from 1% to 3.7%. The average annual inflation for the entire

decade was only 2.04% 101

Science and technology

Technology

The recently invented bipolar transistor, though initially quite feeble, had clear potential and was rapidly improved
and developed at the beginning of the 1950s by companies such as GE, RCA, and Philco. The first commercial
transistor production started at the Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in October, 1951 with the
point contact germanium transistor. It was not until around 1954 that transistor products began to achieve real
commercial success with small portable radios.
A breakthrough in semiconductor technology came with the invention of the
MOSFET (metal—oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), also known as
the MOS transistor, by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs, HI

Television, which first reached the marketplace in the 1940s, attained
maturity during the 1950s and by the end of the decade, most American
households owned a TV set. A rush to produce larger screens than the tiny
ones found on 1940s models occurred during 1950-52. In 1954, RCA intro
Bell Telephone Labs produced the first Solar battery. In 1954, a yard of
contact paper could be purchased for only 59 cents. Polypropylene was
invented in 1954. In 1955, Jonas Salk invented a polio vaccine which was
given to more than seven million American students. In 1956, a solar
powered wrist watch was invented.

In 1957, a 184-pound (83 kg) satellite named Sputnik 1 was launched by the
Soviets. The space race began four months later as the United States
launched a smaller satellite.
