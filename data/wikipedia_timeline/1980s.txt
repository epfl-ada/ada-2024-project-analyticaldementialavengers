1980s
The 1980s (pronounced "nineteen-eighties",
shortened to "the '80s" or "the Eighties") was
the decade that began on January 1, 1980, and
ended on December 31, 1989.
The decade saw a dominance of conservatism
and free market economics, and a
socioeconomic change due to advances in
technology and a worldwide move away from
planned economies and towards laissez-faire
capitalism compared to the 1970s. As economic
deconstruction increased in the developed
world, multiple multinational corporations
associated with the manufacturing industry
relocated into Thailand, Mexico, South Korea,
Taiwan, and China. Japan and West Germany
saw large economic growth during this decade.
The AIDS epidemic became recognized in the
1980s and has since killed an estimated 40.4
million people (as of 2022).[1] Global warming
theory began to spread within the scientific and
political community in the 1980s.
The United Kingdom and the United States
moved closer to supply-side economic policies,
beginning a trend towards global instability of
international trade that would pick up more
steam in the following decade as the fall of the
USSR made right-wing economic policy more
powerful.

From left, clockwise: The first Space Shuttle,
Columbia, lifts off in 1981; US president Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ease tensions
between the two superpowers, leading to the end of
the Cold War; The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is
considered to be one of the most momentous events of
the 1980s; In 1981, the IBM Personal Computer is
released; In 1985, the Live Aid concert is held in order
to fund relief efforts for the famine in Ethiopia during the
time Mengistu Haile Mariam ruled the country; Pollution
and ecological problems persisted when the Soviet
Union and much of the world is filled with radioactive
debris from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and in 1984,
when thousands of people perished in Bhopal during a
gas leak from a pesticide plant; The Iran–Iraq War
leads to over one million dead and $1 trillion spent,
while another war between the Soviets and Afghans
leaves over 2 million dead.

The final decade of the Cold War opened with
the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely
without any interruption. Superpower tensions
escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped
the policy of détente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world
came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, but the
second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse
of Soviet communism.

Developing countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from
multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Ethiopia witnessed widespread famine in the
mid-1980s during the corrupt rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam, resulting in the country having to depend
on foreign aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to address and raise money to help
Ethiopians, such as the Live Aid concert in 1985.
Major civil discontent and violence occurred, including the Angolan Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War,
the Moro conflict, the Salvadoran Civil War, the Ugandan Bush War, the insurgency in Laos, the Iran–
Iraq War, the Soviet–Afghan War, the 1982 Lebanon War, the Falklands War, the Second Sudanese Civil
War, the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. Islamism became a
powerful political force in the 1980s and many jihadist organizations, including Al Qaeda, were set up.
By 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc, and the desire for democracy in
socialist states, combined with economic recession, resulted in Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and
perestroika, which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of
capitalism such as joint ventures with companies from capitalist countries. After tension for most of the
decade, by 1988 relations between the communist and capitalist blocs had improved significantly[2] and
the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states.
1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow of a number of governments led by communist
parties, such as in Hungary, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China, the Czechoslovak "Velvet
Revolution", Erich Honecker's East German regime, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and the violent
overthrow of the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime in Romania. Destruction of the 155-km Berlin Wall, at the
end of the decade, signaled a seismic geopolitical shift. The Cold War ended in the early 1990s with the
successful Reunification of Germany and the USSR's demise after the August Coup of 1991.
The 1980s was an era of tremendous population growth around the world, surpassing the 1970s and
1990s, and arguably being the largest in human history. During the 1980s, the world population grew
from 4.4 to 5.3 billion people. There were approximately 1.33 billion births and 480 million deaths.
Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian
countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually. The 1980s
saw the advent of the ongoing practice of sex-selective abortion in China and India as ultrasound
technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.[3]
The 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology. After years of animal experimentation
since 1985, the first genetic modification of 10 adult human beings took place in May 1989, a gene
tagging experiment[4] which led to the first true gene therapy implementation in September 1990. The
first "designer babies", a pair of female twins, were created in a laboratory in late 1989 and born in July
1990 after being sex-selected via the controversial assisted reproductive technology procedure
preimplantation genetic diagnosis.[5] Gestational surrogacy was first performed in 1985 with the first
birth in 1986, making it possible for a woman to become a biological mother without experiencing
pregnancy for the first time in history.[6]
The global internet took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s, as well as many other
computer networks of both academic and commercial use such as USENET, Fidonet, and the Bulletin
Board System. By 1989, the Internet and the networks linked to it were a global system with extensive
transoceanic satellite links and nodes in most developed countries.[7] Based on earlier work, from 1980

onwards Tim Berners-Lee formalized the concept of the World Wide Web by 1989. Television viewing
became commonplace in the Third World, with the number of TV sets in China and India increasing by
15 and 10 times respectively.[8]
The Atari Video Computer System console became widespread in the first part of the decade, often
simply called "Atari". 1980 Atari VCS port of Space Invaders was the first killer app. The video game
crash of 1983 ended the system's popularity and decimated the industry until the Nintendo Entertainment
System re-established the console market in North America. The hand-held Game Boy launched in 1989.
Super Mario Bros. and Tetris were the decade's best selling games. Pac-Man was the highest grossing
arcade game. Home computers became commonplace. The 1981 IBM PC led to a large market for IBM
PC compatibles. The 1984 release of the Macintosh popularized the WIMP style of interaction.

Socialist countries in 1985

The most notable wars of the decade include:
The Cold War (1947–1991)
Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) – a war fought
between the Soviet Union and the Islamist
Mujahideen Resistance in Afghanistan. The
mujahideen found other support from a variety of
sources including the Central Intelligence Agency of
the United States (see Operation Cyclone), as well
as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations
through the context of the Cold War and the regional
Invasion of Grenada, October 1983
India–Pakistan conflict.
Invasion of Grenada (1983) – a 1983 U.S.-led
invasion of Grenada, triggered by a military coup
which ousted a brief revolutionary government. The successful invasion led to a change
of government but was controversial due to charges of American imperialism, Cold War
politics, the involvement of Cuba, the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and
Grenada's status as a Commonwealth realm.
Salvadoran Civil War (1980–1992) – part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in
the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died.
Cambodian–Vietnamese War (1978-1991)
Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, sparking the Falklands War. It occurred from April 2
to July 14, 1982, between the United Kingdom and Argentina as British forces fought to
recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international affairs and its
long-decaying reputation as a colonial power received an unexpected boost. The military
junta of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader

Leopoldo Galtieri was deposed three days after the end of the war. A military investigation
known as the Rattenbach Report even recommended his execution.
Arab–Israeli conflict (early 20th century – present)
1982 Lebanon War – the Government of Israel ordered the invasion as a response to
the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo
Argov, by the Abu Nidal Organization and due to the constant terror attacks on northern
Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the
PLO, as well as Syrian, leftist and Muslim Lebanese forces, Israel occupied southern
Lebanon and eventually surrounded the PLO in west Beirut and subjected to heavy
bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon.
In October 1985 eight Israeli F-15 Eagles carried out Operation Wooden Leg intending
to bomb the PLO's new headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, more than 2,000 km from Israel.
The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later
condemned by the United Nations Security Council. The United States is thought to
have assisted or known of the attack.
The Iran–Iraq War took place from 1980 to 1988. Iraq was accused of using illegal chemical
weapons to kill Iranian forces and against its own dissident Kurdish populations. Both sides
suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suffered worse for it,
being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an
armistice in 1988.
The United States launched an aerial bombardment of Libya in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan
support of terrorism and attacks on US personnel in Germany and Turkey.
The South African Border War between South Africa and the alliance of Angola, Namibia
and Zambia ended in 1989, ending over thirty years of conflict.
The United States engaged in significant direct and indirect conflict in the decade via
alliances with various groups in a number of Central and South American countries claiming
that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of communism and end illicit drug trade.
The U.S. government supported the government of Colombia's attempts to destroy its
large illicit cocaine-trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military
government in the Salvadoran civil war which became controversial after the El Mozote
massacre on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed
1000 Salvadoran civilians.
The United States, along with members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean
States, invaded Grenada in 1983.
The Iran–Contra affair erupted which involved U.S. interventionism supporting the
Contras in Nicaragua, resulting in members of the U.S. government being indicted in
1986.
U.S. military action began against Panama in December 1989 to overthrow its dictator,
Manuel Noriega resulting in 3,500 civilian casualties and the restoration of democratic
rule.
Battle of Cuito Cuanavale took place as part of the Angolan Civil War and South African
Border War from 1987 to 1988. The battle involved the largest fighting in Africa since World
War II between military forces from Angola, Cuba (expeditionary forces) and Namibia versus
military forces from South Africa and the dissident Angolan UNITA organization.
The First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Azerbaijan and the Armenia started in 1988 and
ended in 1994.
The United States invasion of Panama in December 1989 led to the deposition of Manuel
Noriega.
Civil wars and guerrilla wars

The most notable internal conflicts of the decade include:
The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 occurred in the People's Republic of China in
1989, in which pro-democracy protesters demanded political reform. The protests were
crushed by the People's Liberation Army.
The First Intifada (First Uprising) in the Gaza Strip and West Bank began in 1987 when
Palestinian Arabs mounted large-scale protests against the Israeli military presence in the
Gaza Strip and West Bank, largely inhabited by Palestinians. The First Intifada would
continue until peace negotiations began between the Palestinian Liberation Organization
(PLO) and the Israeli government in 1993.
Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) – Throughout the decade, Lebanon was engulfed in civil
war between Islamic and Christian factions.
The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front began a violent campaign for independence in
New Caledonia.
Greenpeace's attempts to monitor French nuclear testing on Mururoa were halted by the
sinking of the Rainbow Warrior.
The Second Sudanese Civil War erupts in 1983 between the Muslim government of Sudan
in the north and non-Muslim rebel secessionists in Southern Sudan. The conflict continues
through the present day Darfur genocide.
1986 Egyptian conscripts riot: On 25 February 1986 around 25,000 conscripts of the Central
Security Forces (CSF), an Egyptian paramilitary force, staged violent protests in and around
Cairo, due to the rumour that their three-year mandatory service would be prolonged by one
additional year without any additional benefits or rank promotion. It was suppressed by the
army.
Internal conflict in Peru: The communist Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement starts its
fight against the Peruvian state in 1980, that would continue until the end of the 1990s.

El Al airline. The attack was done by militants loyal to Abu Nidal, backed by the government
of Libya.
Air India Flight 182 was destroyed on June 23, 1985, by Sikh-Canadian militants. It was the
biggest mass murder involving Canadians in Canada's history.
On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the village of Lockerbie,
Scotland, while en route from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK. The bombing
killed all 259 people on board, 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on
the ground, totaling 270 fatalities who were citizens of 21 nationalities. The bombing was
and remains the worst terrorist attack on UK soil.

Coups
The most prominent coups d'état of the decade include:
A military coup is launched in Suriname on February 25, 1980; the country's politics are
dominated by the military until 1991.
Nigeria suffered multiple military coups in 1983 and 1985.
Sitiveni Rabuka staged two military coups in Fiji in 1987, and declared the country a republic
the same year.

Yugoslavia from 1988 to 1989 through mass protests organized and committed by
supporters of Serbian politician Slobodan Milošević overthrow the governments of Serbia's
autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and the government of Montenegro, and
finally the main government of Serbia with Milošević becoming President of Serbia.

Nuclear threats
Operation Opera – a 1981 surprise Israeli air strike that
destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor being constructed
near Baghdad. Israeli military intelligence assumed this
was for the purpose of plutonium production to further an
Iraqi nuclear weapons program. Israeli intelligence also
believed that the summer of 1981 would be the last
chance to destroy the reactor before it would be loaded
with nuclear fuel.
US President Reagan's decision to station intermediaterange nuclear missiles in Western Europe provoked
mass protests involving more than one million people.

Decolonization and independence
Following the decolonization and independence of the Commonwealth realms.
In 1982, Canada gained official independence from the United Kingdom with the Canada
Act 1982, authorized by the signature by Elizabeth II. This act severed all political
dependencies of the United Kingdom in Canada (although the Queen remained the
head of state).
In 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom with the Australia
Act 1986, which severed the last remaining powers of the British government over the

Australian government, including the removal of the privy council as the highest court of
appeal. Australia retained the queen as head of state.
In 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom fully separated New Zealand's
governments from the influence of the British Parliament, resulting in New Zealand's full
independence with the Constitution Act 1986 which also reorganized the New Zealand
government.
Independence was granted to Vanuatu from the British/French condominium (1980),
Kiribati from joint US-British government (1981) and Palau from the United States
(1986).

and Nevis (1983) in the Caribbean; Brunei (1984) and Thailand formed a US-British
government (1981) in Southeast Asia.

Prominent political events
Americas
Ronald Reagan was elected U.S. president in 1980. In
international affairs, Reagan pursued a hardline policy
towards preventing the spread of communism, initiating
a considerable buildup of U.S. military power to
challenge the Soviet Union. He further directly
challenged the Iron Curtain by demanding that the
Soviet Union dismantle the Berlin Wall.
The Reagan Administration accelerated the War on

General Secretary Gorbachev

signing the INF Treaty, 1987
Drugs gained attention in the US as a serious problem in
the '80s. Cocaine was relatively popular among
celebrities and affluent youth, while crack, a cheaper
offshoot of the drug, was linked to high crime rates in inner cities during the American crack
epidemic.
The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968) (PATCO) declared a strike on
August 3, 1981, seeking better working conditions, better pay, and a 32-hour workweek. The
strike caused considerable disruption of the U.S. air transportation system. Resolution came
when Ronald Reagan fired over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his
order to return to work, banning them from federal service for life. After seeking appeals,
many of the controllers were re-hired while the FAA attempted to replace much of their air
traffic control staffing. The remainder continued to be banned until President Clinton lifted
the final aspects in 1993.
Political unrest in the province of Quebec, which, due to the many differences between the
dominant francophone population and the anglophone minority, and also to francophone
rights in the predominantly English-speaking Canada, came to a head in 1980 when the
provincial government called a public referendum on partial separation from the rest of
Canada. The referendum ended with the "no" side winning majority (59.56% no, 40.44%
yes).

Military dictatorships give way to democracy in Argentina (1983), Uruguay (1984–85), Brazil
(1985–1988) and Chile (1988–89). This marked the end of the Operation Condor for 30
years.
Europe
The European Community's enlargement continued with the
accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986.
In 1983, Bettino Craxi became the first socialist to hold the office of
Prime Minister of Italy; he remained in power until 1987, becoming
one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in the history of Italian
Republic. At the end of his presidency the Mani pulite corruption
scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system.
Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist
countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries
grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing
communist governments. These reforms included attempts to
increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and
promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in

While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was
booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the
city with his wife Elena. Two days later, they were captured,
charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas Day.
In Yugoslavia, following the death of communist leader Josip Broz
Tito in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist
system occurred along with a trend towards ethnic nationalism and
inter-ethnic hostility, especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986

Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985,
and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of
expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while
maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with
the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the Cold War.
During the Revolutions of 1989, most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe
collapsed. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the German
reunification.
The United Kingdom was governed by the Conservative Party under Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, the first female leader of a Western country. Under her Premiership, the
party introduced widespread economic reforms including the privatisation of industries and
the de-regulation of stock markets echoing similar reforms of U.S. President Ronald
Reagan. She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname The
Iron Lady.

Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the UK miners' strike (1984–
85) was a major industrial action affecting the UK coal industry. The strike by the National
Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was led by Arthur Scargill, although some NUM members
considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The BBC has referred to the
strike as "the most bitter industrial dispute in British history."[9] At its height, the strike
involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the 1926 General Strike.[10]
In November 1982, Leonid Brezhnev, who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He
was followed in quick succession by Yuri Andropov, the former KGB chief, and Konstantin
Chernenko, both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in office.
Asia
Following the assassination of Park Chung-hee, South Korean president Chun Doo Hwan
came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired
in 1987. He was responsible for the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980 when police and soldiers
battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement
during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, a bomb apparently planted by North
Korean agents killed a number of South Korean government officials. The June Democratic
Struggle in 1987, a nationwide pro-democracy movement in South Korea, leads to
democratic reforms, an end to authoritarian rule and democratic elections. After leaving
office, Chun was succeeded by Roh Tae Woo, the first democratic ruler of the country, which
saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988. Roh pursued a
policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant leftwing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea and the withdrawal of
US troops.
In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president Ferdinand
Marcos left the presidency and was replaced by Corazon Aquino through the "People Power
Revolution" from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful
revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to
disperse the crowds on EDSA (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila).
Democratization in South Korea and Taiwan, having lasted 42 and 27 years under the
authoritarian regime since the end of World War II and the Korean War (including the lifting
of martial law in Taiwan and the first direct presidential elections in South Korea).
The 1988 Summer Olympics were held in South Korea, the first time the country hosted
them.
Africa
A widespread famine hit Ethiopia from 1983 to 1985, affecting 7.75 million people, killing
around 300,000 to 1.2 million. 400,000 refugees left the country. Blame for the famine has
been attributed to drought, Ethiopia's civil war, and policies taken by the Derg military
regime.

15,000–20,000 lives.
On May 29, 1985, the Heysel Stadium disaster occurred before the European Cup final in
Brussels, Belgium, when a crowd crush led to 39 deaths and 600 injuries.
On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 flying from Montreal to Bombay via
London and Delhi, is blown up over Irish waters by a bomb planted by Sikh separatists,
killing all 320 passengers and crew on board. This was the deadliest act of aviation terrorism
until the September 11 attacks of 2001.
On August 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, crashed on
approach to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas due to a microburst. 137 people
were killed while 27 survived.

Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747 carrying 524 people, crashed on August 12, 1985,

survivors. This was the deadliest single-aircraft crash to date.
On December 12, 1985, Arrow Air Flight 1285, a Douglas DC-8, stalled and crashed
seconds after taking off from Gander, Newfoundland. All 256 people on board, many of them
U.S. servicemen returning home from duty overseas, perished.
On January 28, 1986, the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after
launch, killing all of the crew on board. This was the first disaster involving the destruction of
a NASA Space Shuttle. A faulty O-ring was the cause of the accident.
On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl disaster, a large-scale nuclear meltdown in the Ukrainian
SSR, Soviet Union, spread a large amount of radioactive material across Europe, killing 47
people, dooming countless others to future radiation-related cancer, and causing the
displacement of 300,000 people.
On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498, a Douglas DC-9, crashed after colliding with a
private Piper Cherokee over Cerritos, California, killing 64 on both aircraft and 15 others on
the ground. On the same day, the Soviet passenger ship Admiral Nakhimov sank after
colliding with the bulk carrier Pyotr Vasev in the Black Sea, killing 423 people.

engine failure and subsequently crashed, killing all 183 passengers and crew.
On August 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, crashed
almost immediately after takeoff Detroit Wayne Airport in Michigan due to pilot error, killing
156 on board.
On November 28, 1987, a fire broke out on South African Airways Flight 295, a Boeing 747,
eventually causing the aircraft to crash into the Indian Ocean. All 159 aboard were killed.
On December 20, 1987, the Philippine passenger ferry MV Doña Paz burned and sank after
colliding with the oil tanker MT Vector off the island of Marinduque. With an estimated death
toll of over 4,000, this was and remains the world's deadliest peacetime maritime disaster.
On July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655, an Airbus A300 en route from Tehran to Dubai via
Bandar Abbas, was shot down by the U.S. missile cruiser USS Vincennes over the Strait of
Hormuz, killing all 290 people on the plane. The event is one of the most controversial
aviation occurrences of all time, with the true cause disputed between the Americans and
the Iranians.
On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747 en route from Frankfurt to Detroit
(via London and New York), was destroyed by a bomb while it was flying over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing the 259 passengers and crew members on board and 11 people on the
ground. This was the worst terrorist attack to have occurred on British soil.
On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Alaska's
Prince William Sound spilling an estimated equivalent of 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of
crude oil. Although not among the largest oil spills in history, its remote and sensitive
location made it one of the most devastating ecological disasters, with after-effects
continuing to be felt present-day.
On April 15, 1989, The Hillsborough disaster occurs during a FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield,
England, fatally crushing 96 football fans and injuring nearly 1,000 more.
On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 carrying 296
people, suffered an in-flight engine failure and was forced to crash-land at Sioux City, Iowa.
185 survived, while 111 were killed when the plane burst into flames upon touchdown.

Science and technology
Medicine and biology

The 1980s had many fundamental advances in medicine and biology. The first surrogate pregnancy of an
unrelated child took place on April 13, 1986, in Michigan.[6] The first genetically modified crops, tobacco
(Nicotiana) plants were grown in China in 1988.[23]
Gene therapy techniques became established by the end of the 1980s, allowing gene tagging and gene
therapy to become a possibility, both of which were first performed in human beings in May 1989 and
September 1990, respectively.

Electronics and computers
Arcade and video games had been growing in popularity since the late 1970s, and by 1982 were a major
industry. But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers,
caused a tremendous crash in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically
ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by Nintendo, whose
Famicom console and mascot Mario had been enjoying considerable success in Japan since 1983.
Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), it would claim 90% of the American video game
market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive
popularity. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video
games of all time. Also in 1980, Game & Watch was created; it was not one of the most well known game
systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. Donkey Kong, released in 1981,
was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for Nintendo. Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2,
Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and the Mega Man series would become major hits for the
console.

Mega Drive, known as the
Genesis in North America,

The personal computer experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to
a full-fledged consumer product. The IBM PC, launched in 1981, became the dominant computer for
professional users. Commodore created the most popular home computers of both 8-bit and 16-bit
generations. MSX standard was the dominant computer platform in Japan and in most parts of Asia.
Apple Computer superseded its Apple II and Lisa models by introducing the first Macintosh computer in
1984. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI)
and mouse,[24] which started to become general features in computers after the middle of the decade.
Electronics and computers were also at the forefront of the advertising industry, with many commercials
like "1984" from Apple achieving acclaim and pop-culture relevance.[25]

IBM PC (model 5150), the first
DOS-compatible PC was
released in 1981. The IBM PCs
and compatible models from
other vendors would become
the most widely used computer
systems in the world.

Commodore 64, with sales
estimated at more than 17
million units between 1982 and
1994 became the best-selling
computer model of all time.

home/personal computer, was
introduced in October 1987.[27]

Walkman and boomboxes, invented during the late 1970s, became very popular as they were introduced
to various countries in the early 1980s, and had a profound impact on the music industry and youth
culture. Consumer VCRs and video rental stores became commonplace as VHS won out over the
competing Betamax standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact,
modestly priced synthesizers to the public. This, along with the development of Musical Instrument
Digital Interface (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic
instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.
High definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the
1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.
In 1981, Hayes Microcomputer Products started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the
way for the modern modems that exist today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what
had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem
contributed to the rise in popularity of BBS systems in the 1980s and early 1990s, which were the main
way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the
Internet and the World Wide Web finally became popular in the mid-1990s.

Information technology
During the decade Microsoft released the operating systems MS-DOS (1981), Windows 1.0
(1985), and Windows 2.0 (1987).
The CD - the most basic CD ("Digital Audio Compact Disc") was released in October 1982
for distribution and listening to digital audio, and at the time contained up to 74 minutes of
music.
TCP/IP: ARPANET officially changed its main protocol from NCP to TCP/IP on January 1,
1983, when the new protocols were activated. The TCP/IP protocol will become the

dominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as the
foundation on which the Internet would be based.
The GNU Project (1983). The Free Software Foundation (1985).
FidoNet - In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling BBS users to send private messages
(e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connected
to the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other. The rise in popularity and
availability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed to
the irrelevance of FidoNet.
World Wide Web - In 1989, the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee first proposed a
project to his employer CERN, based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and
updating information among researchers. In mid-November 1989 he would develop the first
successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server
via the internet. In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would later
become the foundation of the World Wide Web.

In 1981, Microsoft introduced
the MS-DOS operating system,
which would become the world's
most widely used operating
system in the 1980s and first
half of the 1990s.

Space exploration
American interplanetary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After
making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980–1981. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in
1986 (just a few days before the Challenger disaster), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the
Solar System.

No American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the
Viking probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations
by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they
failed.
The arrival of Halley's Comet in 1986 was met by a series of
Soviet, Japanese and European Space Agency (ESA) probes,
namely Halley Armada.
After a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts
resumed with the launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia in April
1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with
The Space Shuttle Columbia
three more orbiters entering service in 1983–1985. But that all
seconds after engine ignition, 1981
came to an end with the tragic loss of the Challenger (STS-51-L)
on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including
Christa McAuliffe, who was to have been the first teacher in space. In full view of the world, a faulty Oring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it
to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve NASA's
increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer. Flights resumed with the
launch of Discovery in September 1988.
The Soviet program with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks.
The Salyut 6 space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by Salyut 7 in 1982. Then came Mir in 1986,
which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet
space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last "superprojects" was the Buran space
shuttle; it was only used once, in 1988.

Automobiles
The American auto industry began in the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality
control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn.[28] Chrysler and American Motors
(AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off.[29] Only General Motors (GM) continued
with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales
in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would
begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto
maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built Yugo was brought to the US,
but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.
As the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford design teams
began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of
the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus with a design that was
revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.
GM began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith's
restructuring attempts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars. An example were customers who
increasingly purchased European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs. In 1985, GM started Saturn (the first

new American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters. Production
would not begin until 1990.
Chrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive K-cars in 1981. Under the leadership of Lee
Iacocca, the company turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans.
A succession of models using this automobile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans
in 1984. These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade.
In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lamborghini and Maserati. In the same year, Chrysler
bought AMC from Renault laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker, but acquiring
the hugely profitable Jeep line and continuing the Eagle brand until the late 1990s.[30]
The DMC DeLorean was the brainchild of John DeLorean, a flamboyant former GM executive.
Production of the gull-winged sports car began in Northern Ireland in 1981. John DeLorean was arrested
in October 1982 in a sting operation where he was attempting to sell cocaine to save his struggling
company. He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company, which
closed down in 1983. The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the Back to
the Future film trilogy.
The imposition of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) fuel-mileage standards in 1979 spelled the
end of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles reemerged in the 1980s. Turbochargers
were widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from fuel injection began to
take over from the widely used application of carburetors by the late 1980s. Front-wheel drive also
became dominant.
The 1980s marked the decline of European brands in North America by the end of the decade. Renault,
Citroen, and Peugeot ceased importation by the end of the decade. Alfa Romeo would continue until
1993. Fiat also ceased imports to North America in the 1980s.

Economics
The early 1980s was marked by a severe global economic recession that affected much of
the developed world.
Inflation peaked in the U.S. in April 1980 at 14.76% and subsequently fell to a low of 1.10%
in December 1986 but then rebounded to 4.65% at the end of the decade.[31]
Finland's economy grew by almost the fastest pace in the world, which eventually
culminated in the recession of the 1990s Finnish economy. In Finland, the 1980s were
called the "Nousukausi", or "economic upswing".
In the late 1980s, Japan experienced an economic bubble, which would culminate in a stock
market crash in 1991 that would begin a period of economic stagnation.
Developing countries reliant on loans from the International Monetary Fund would
experience debt crises throughout the 1980s.
Laissez faire and neoliberal economics have a resurgence in the developed world, led by
the UK and US which emphasised reduced government intervention, lower taxes and
deregulation of the stock markets, measures that became associated with an economic
revival in the mid- to late-1980s.
Brazil and Mexico suffers from a debt crisis in Latin America starting in 1982 under
President João Figueiredo and Miguel de la Madrid. Economic problems worsened between
1979 and 1985 by firing and resignation of most officials of the Brazilian and Mexican

government after the Diretas Já movement in 1984, and a failed response of emergency aid
in the Mexico City earthquake just after the 175th anniversary of independence holiday in
1985. Tancredo Neves (later succeeded by José Sarney three months later) and Carlos
Salinas de Gortari won a direct presidential election in 1985 marked the end of a 21-year
military dictatorship, and a controversial presidential election in 1988 amid charges of voter
fraud, bribery, corruption and other abuses of power.
Enactment of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1989 to further establish
a strong economic bond between the two prosperous neighbor countries of North America.
In the Soviet Union, the eleventh Five-Year Plan was initiated in 1981 during a period of
economic stagnation that began in the late 1970s. The Plan was a near failure, as most of
the targets were not met. With the ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the
Communist Party, the twelfth Five-Year Plan sought to accelerate and restructure the Soviet
economy through reforms to decentralize production and distribution systems.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China embarked on extensive reforms in the 1980s,
opening the country's economy to the West and allowing capitalist enterprises to operate in
a market socialist system. The corruption of Communist Party leadership was met by
dissent from students and workers in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 which were
suppressed by the People's Liberation Army.
The Solidarity movement began in Poland in 1980, involving workers demanding political
liberalization and democracy in Poland. Attempts by the Communist government to prevent
the rise of the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and the
government took place. Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in other
communist states to demand political reform.
The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been since
the 1920s, and figures like Donald Trump and Michael Milken were widely seen as symbols
of the decade. Widespread fear of Japanese economic strength would grip the United
States in the 1980s.
The "Black Monday" stock market crash on October 19, 1987, decreased the value of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 22%, causing widespread secondary drops in
world markets.
During the 1980s, for the first time in world history, transpacific trade (with East Asia, such
as China, and Latin America, primarily with Mexico) equaled that of transatlantic trade (with
Western Europe or with neighboring Canada),[32] solidifying American economic power.[33]
The Savings and Loan crisis and Keating five scandal.
The phrase Big Bang, used in reference to the sudden deregulation of financial markets,
was coined to describe measures, including abolition of fixed commission charges and of
the distinction between stockjobbers and stockbrokers on the London Stock Exchange and
change from open-outcry to electronic, screen-based trading, effected by Margaret Thatcher
in 1986.

Popular culture

The third generation of video
game consoles like SG-1000,
Master System, Nintendo
Entertainment System
(pictured), and Atari 7800 were
released in the 1980s.

TV shows like Full House, The
Golden Girls, Miami Vice,
Family Ties, Cheers, Dynasty,
ALF, and Dallas were popular in
the 1980s.

Michael Jackson's Thriller
became the best-selling album
of all time, followed by the
critically acclaimed album Bad
five years later, and a musical
film adaptation titled
Moonwalker.

MTV was launched in 1981,
which had a great influence on
the way music is marketed and
on the rise of many prominent
rock stars during the decade.
Early CGI also caught on within
music videos in the 1980s,
including the popular music
video for "Money for Nothing".

Technological advancements
Polaroid-branded cameras were
like early personal computers,
popular and at their height in the
the IBM Personal Computer,
1980s.
Commodore 64 (pictured), and
Macintosh 128K were popular in
the 1980s.

He-Man and the Masters of the
Universe and other cartoons like
The Smurfs, The Transformers,
Inspector Gadget, DuckTales,
ThunderCats, and Alvin and the
Chipmunks were popular in the
1980s.

Cassette tapes used for music
listening and operating the Sony
Walkman were popular in the
decade.

Arcade games like Pac-Man,
Donkey Kong, Frogger,
Defender, Galaga, Centipede,
and Joust, were popular during
the golden age of arcade video
games.

Six Olympic Games were held
in the 1980s, Lake Placid and
Moscow in 1980, Sarajevo and
Los Angeles in 1984, Calgary
and Seoul in 1988.

1980s teen-oriented films like
Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Back to
the Future, The Breakfast Club,
Stand by Me, and The Outsiders
were popular under the Reagan
era.

After a turbulent decline in the
1960s and 1970s, animation
began to thrive again due to the
success and popularity of films
such as Who Framed Roger
Rabbit, Oliver & Company, The
Land Before Time, and The
Little Mermaid.

Along with early hip hop culture
like 1988's Straight Outta
Compton, graffiti became more
mainstream in the 1980s.

Before the more mainstream
use of the internet in the 1990s,
many computer systems had
searchable databases during
the decade. These databases
could be used to search a
students' grades, computerized
library and video rental systems
to track books and video rentals.

Ronald Reagan was president
of the United States for a
majority of the 1980s (19811989), during what was called
the Reagan era. Ronald
Reagan's vice president George
H.W. Bush became president in
1989.



Video gaming
Popular video games include: Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy,
Castlevania, Metroid, Mega Man, Donkey Kong, Frogger, Dig Dug, and Tetris. Pac-Man was the first
game to achieve widespread popularity in mainstream culture and the first game character to be popular
in his own right.
Handheld electronic LCD games was introduced into the youth market segment. The primary gaming
computers of the 1980s emerged in 1982: the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Nintendo finally decided
in 1985 to release its Famicom (released in 1983 in Japan) in the United States under the name Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES). It was bundled with Super Mario Bros. and it suddenly became a success.
The NES dominated the American and Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in
the early 1990s, causing some to call this time the Nintendo era. Sega released its 16-bit console, Mega
Drive/Genesis, in 1988 in Japan and in North America in 1989. In 1989, Nintendo released the Game
Boy, a monochrome handheld console.
