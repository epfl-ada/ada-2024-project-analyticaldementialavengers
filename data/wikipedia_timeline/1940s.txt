1940s
The 1940s (pronounced "nineteen-forties" and commonly
abbreviated as "the '40s" or "the Forties") was a decade
that began on January 1, 1940, and ended on December 31,
1949.
Most of World War II took place in the first half of the
decade, which had a profound effect on most countries and
people in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. The consequences
of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade,
with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling
spheres of influence of the Western world and the Soviet
Union, leading to the beginning of the Cold War. To some
degree internal and external tensions in the post-war era
were managed by new institutions, including the United
Nations, the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system,
facilitating the post–World War II economic expansion,
which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the
post-war world encouraged decolonization and the
emergence of new states and governments, with India,
Pakistan, Israel, Vietnam, and others declaring
independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The
decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new
technologies (such as computers, nuclear power, and jet
propulsion), often first developed in tandem with the war
effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war
era.
The world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5
billion over the course of the decade, with about 850
million births and 600 million deaths in total.

hurban[1]) is the term generally used to describe the genocide
of approximately six million European Jews during World War
II, a program of systematic state-sponsored extermination by
Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, its allies, and
collaborators.[2] Some scholars maintain that the definition of
the Holocaust should also include the Nazis' systematic
murder of millions of people in other groups, including ethnic
Poles, the Romani, Soviet civilians, Soviet prisoners of war,
people with disabilities, gay men, and political and religious
opponents.[3] By this definition, the total number of Holocaust
victims is between 11 million and 17 million people.[4]

Technology
The Atanasoff-Berry computer is now considered one of the first electronic digital
computing device built by John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry at Iowa State
University during 1937–1942.
Construction in early 1941 of the Heath Robinson Bombe & the Colossus computer,
which was used by British codebreakers at Bletchley Park and satellite stations
nearby to read Enigma encrypted German messages during World War II. This was
operational until 1946 when it was destroyed under orders from Winston Churchill.
This is now widely regarded as the first operational computer which in a model
rebuild still today has a remarkable computing speed.

was built.

Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary
between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war is
unclear. Overall, about 5.7 million (78 percent) of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe perished
(Gilbert, Martin. Atlas of the Holocaust 1988, pp. 242–244). Compared to five to 11 million (1.4
