1930s
The 1930s (pronounced "nineteen-thirties" and commonly
abbreviated as "the '30s" or "the Thirties") was a decade
that began on January 1, 1930, and ended on December 31,
1939. In the United States, the Dust Bowl led to the
nickname the "Dirty Thirties".
The decade was defined by a global economic and political
crisis that culminated in the Second World War. It saw the
collapse of the international financial system, beginning
with the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the largest stock market
crash in American history. The subsequent economic
downfall, called the Great Depression, had traumatic social
effects worldwide, leading to widespread poverty and
unemployment, especially in the economic superpower of
the United States and in Germany, which was already
struggling with the payment of reparations for the First
World War. The Dust Bowl in the United States (which led
to the nickname the "Dirty Thirties") exacerbated the
scarcity of wealth. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
who took office in 1933, introduced a program of broadscale social reforms and stimulus plans called the New
Deal in response to the crisis. The Soviet Union's second
five-year plan gave heavy industry top priority, putting the
Soviet Union not far behind Germany as one of the major
steel-producing countries of the world, while also
improving communications. First-wave feminism made
advances, with women gaining the right to vote in South
Africa (1930, whites only), Brazil (1933), and Cuba
(1933). Following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the
emergence of the NSDAP as the country's sole legal party
in 1933, Germany imposed a series of laws which
discriminated against Jews and other ethnic minorities.

From left, clockwise: Dorothea Lange's photo of the
homeless Florence Thompson shows the effects of the
Great Depression; due to extreme drought conditions,
farms across the south-central United States become
dry and the Dust Bowl spreads; The Empire of Japan
invades China, which eventually leads to the Second
Sino-Japanese War. In 1937, Japanese soldiers
massacre civilians in Nanjing; aviator Amelia Earhart
becomes an American flight icon; German dictator Adolf
Hitler and the Nazi Party attempt to establish a New
Order of German hegemony in Europe, which
culminates in 1939 when Germany invades Poland,
leading to the outbreak of World War II. The Nazis also
persecute Jews in Germany, specifically with
Kristallnacht in 1938; the Hindenburg explodes over a
small New Jersey airfield, causing 36 deaths and
effectively ending commercial airship travel; Mohandas
Gandhi walks to the Arabian Sea in the Salt March of
1930. Popular comedy team The Three Stooges had
prominence during the decade.

Germany adopted an aggressive foreign policy,
remilitarizing the Rhineland (1936), annexing Austria
(1938) and the Sudetenland (1938), before invading Poland
(1939) and starting World War II near the end of the decade. Italy likewise continued its already aggressive foreign
policy, defeating the Libyan resistance (1932) before invading Ethiopia (1935) and then Albania (1939). Both
Germany and Italy became involved in the Spanish Civil War, supporting the eventually victorious Nationalists led
by Francisco Franco against the Republicans, who were in turn supported by the Soviet Union. The Chinese Civil
War was halted due to the need to confront Japanese imperial ambitions, with the Kuomintang and the Chinese
Communist Party forming a Second United Front to fight Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lesser conflicts
included interstate wars such as the Colombia–Peru War (1932–1933), the Chaco War (1932–1935) and the Saudi–
Yemeni War (1934), as well as internal conflicts in Brazil (1932), Ecuador (1932), El Salvador (1932), Austria
(1934) and British Palestine (1936–1939).

Severe famine took place in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union between 1930 and 1933, leading to
5.7 to 8.7 million deaths. Major contributing factors to the famine include: the forced collectivization in the Soviet
Union of agriculture as a part of the First Five-Year Plan, forced grain procurement, combined with rapid
industrialization, a decreasing agricultural workforce, and several severe droughts. A famine of similar scope also
took place in China from 1936 to 1937, killing 5 million people. The 1931 China floods caused 422,499–4,000,000
deaths. Major earthquakes of this decade include the 1935 Quetta earthquake (30,000–60,000 deaths) and the 1939
Erzincan earthquake (32,700–32,968 deaths).
With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over
as the most popular type of film with audiences, with the animated musical fantasy film Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs (1937) becoming the highest-grossing film of this decade in terms of gross rentals. In terms of distributor
rentals, Gone with the Wind (1939), an epic historical romance film, was the highest-grossing film of this decade and
remains the highest-grossing film (when adjusted for inflation) to this day. Popularity of comedy films boomed after
the Silent era with popular comedians The Three Stooges and Marx Brothers. Popular novels of this decade include
the historical fiction novels The Good Earth, Anthony Adverse and Gone with the Wind, all three of which were bestselling novels in the United States for 2 consecutive years. Cole Porter was a popular music artist in the 1930s, with
two of his songs, "Night and Day" and "Begin the Beguine" becoming No. 1 hits in 1932 and 1935 respectively. The
latter song was of the Swing genre, which had begun to emerge as the most popular form of music in the United
States since 1933.
The world population increased from 2.05 to 2.25 billion people during the decade, with about 750 million births
and 550 million deaths.

Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 – September 9, 1945) – fought
between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It was the
largest Asian war of the 20th century,[1] and made up more than 50% of
the casualties in the Pacific theater of World War II.
World War II (September 1, 1939 – September 2, 1945) – global war
centered in Europe and the Pacific but involving the majority of the
world's countries, including all of the major powers such as Germany,
Russia, America, Italy, Japan, France and the United Kingdom.

Internal conflicts

At the outbreak of World
War II, both Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union
invaded Poland; by October
1939, they had divided the
occupied territory between
them in accordance with the
secret part of the Molotov–
Ribbentrop Pact.

Chinese Civil War (1927–1949) – The ruling Kuomintang and the rebel
Chinese Communist Party fought a civil war for control of China. The
Communists consolidated territory in the early 1930s and proclaimed a
short-lived Chinese Soviet Republic that collapsed upon Kuomintang
attacks, forcing a mass retreat known as the Long March. The
Kuomintang and Communists attempted to put away their differences
after 1937 to fight the Japanese invasion of China, but intermittent clashes continued through the
remainder of the 1930s. Even with some clashes they all fought the Japanese.
1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.
Spanish Civil War (July 17, 1936 – April 1, 1939) – Germany and Italy backed the anti-communist
Falange forces of Francisco Franco. The Soviet Union and international communist parties (see
Abraham Lincoln Brigade) backed the left-wing republican faction in the war. The war ended in April
1939 with Franco's nationalist forces defeating the republican forces. Franco became Head of State of
Spain and President of Government, and the Republic of Spain gave way to the Spanish State, an
authoritarian dictatorship.

Major political changes
Germany – Rise of Nazism
The NSDAP (Nazi Party) under Adolf Hitler wins the German
federal election, March 1933. Hitler becomes Chancellor of
Germany. Night of the Long Knives with 85 victims, Following the
1934 death in office of Paul von Hindenburg, President of
Germany, Hitler's cabinet passes a law proclaiming the presidency
vacant and transferring the role and powers of the head of state to
Hitler, hereafter known as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and
chancellor). The Weimar Republic effectively gives way to Nazi
Germany, a totalitarian autocratic national socialist dictatorship
SA paramilitaries outside a Berlin
committed to repudiating the Treaty of Versailles, persecuting and
store during the Nazi boycott of
removing Jews and other minorities from German society,
Jewish businesses, 1933
expanding Germany's territory, and opposing the spread of
communism.
Hitler pulls Germany out of the League of Nations, but hosts the 1936 Summer Olympics to show his
new Reich to the world as well as the supposed superior athleticism of his Aryan troops/athletes.
Neville Chamberlain, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1937–1940), attempts the appeasement
of Hitler in hope of avoiding war by allowing the dictator to annex the Sudetenland (the Germanspeaking regions of Czechoslovakia) and later signing the Munich Agreement and promising
constituents "Peace for our time". He is ousted in favor of Winston Churchill in May 1940, following
the German invasion of Norway.[2]

The assassination of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by a German-born Polish Jew triggers the
Kristallnacht ("Night of Broken Glass") which occurred between 9 and 10 November 1938, carried out
by the Hitler Youth, the Gestapo, and the SS, during which much of the Jewish population living in
Nazi Germany and Austria was attacked – 91 Jews were murdered, and between 25,000 and 30,000
more were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Some 267 synagogues were destroyed,
and thousands of homes and businesses were ransacked. Kristallnacht also served as the pretext for
the wholesale confiscation of firearms from German Jews.
Germany and Italy pursue territorial expansionist agendas.
Germany demands the annexation of the Federal State of Austria
and of other German-speaking territories in Europe. Between
1935 and 1936, Germany recovers the Saar and re-militarizes the
Rhineland. Italy initially opposes Germany's aims for Austria, but in
1936 the two countries resolve their differences in the aftermath of
Italy's diplomatic isolation following the start of the Second ItaloAbyssinian War, and Germany becomes Italy's only remaining ally.
Germany and Italy improve relations by forming an alliance
Cheering crowds greet Adolf Hitler
against communism in 1936 with the signing of the Anti-Comintern
and Benito Mussolini in Munich,
Pact. Germany annexes Austria in the Anschluss; the annexation
1938
of the Sudetenland follows negotiations which result in the Munich
Agreement of 1938. The Italian invasion of Albania in 1939
succeeds in turning the Kingdom of Albania into an Italian
protectorate. The vacant Albanian throne is claimed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.[3] Germany
receives the Memel territory from Lithuania, occupies what remains of Czechoslovakia, and finally
invades the Second Polish Republic, the last of these events resulting in the outbreak of World War II.
In 1939, several countries of the Americas, including Canada, Cuba, and the United States,
controversially deny asylum to hundreds of German Jewish refugees on board the MS St. Louis who
are fleeing the Nazi regime's racist agenda of anti-Semitic persecution in Germany. In the end, no
country accepts the refugees, and the ship returns to Germany with most of its passengers on board.
Some commit suicide, rather than return to Nazi Germany.
United States – Combating the Depression
Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected President of the United States in
November 1932. Roosevelt initiates a widespread social welfare strategy
called the "New Deal" to combat the economic and social devastation of
the Great Depression. The economic agenda of the "New Deal" was a
radical departure from previous laissez-faire economics.
Saudi Arabia – Founding
The Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd is proclaimed the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia, concluding the country's unification under the rule of Ibn Saud.
Spain – Turmoil and Civil War

New Deal: President

The Republican parties win the local elections, and proclaim the Second
Republic, kicking out the monarchy of Alfonso XIII of Borbón.
The Spanish coup of July 1936 against the Republic marks the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

Colonization
The Ethiopian Empire is invaded by the Kingdom of Italy during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War from
1935 to 1936. The occupied territory merges with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland into the colony of
Italian East Africa.

The Empire of Japan captures Manchuria in 1931, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo. A puppet
government was created, with Puyi, the last Qing dynasty Emperor of China, installed as the nominal
regent and emperor.[4]

Decolonization and independence
In March 1930 Mohandas Gandhi leads the non-violent Satyagraha movement in the Declaration of
the Independence of India and the Salt March.
The Government of India Act 1935 creates new directly elected bodies, although with a limited
franchise, and increases the autonomy of the Presidencies and provinces of British India.
The Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 is signed which gradually decreased British influence in Egypt and
increased Egyptian sovereignty. It led to the withdrawal of British troops across Egypt to the Suez
Canal Zone and decreased the number of British troops in the country to 10,000 men.

Other prominent political events
The Great Depression seriously affects the economic, political, and social aspects of society across
the world.
The League of Nations collapses as countries like Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire of
Japan abdicate the League.
Europe
In 1930, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Prime Minister of Spain and
head of a military dictatorship is forced to resign in response to a
financial crisis (part of the Great Depression). Alfonso XIII of
Spain, who had previously backed the dictatorship, attempts to
return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige.
This failed utterly, as the King was considered a supporter of the
dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the
establishment of a republic. In 1931, republican and socialist
parties won a major victory in the local elections, while the
monarchists were in decline. Street riots ensued, calling for the
removal of the monarchy. The Spanish Army declared that they
would not defend the King. Alfonso flees the country, effectively
abdicating and ending the Bourbon Restoration phase which had
started in the 1870s. A Second Spanish Republic emerges.

Silver Jubilee celebration of any British monarch in history.
The "Great Purge" of "Old Bolsheviks" from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union takes place from
1936 to 1938, as ordered by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, resulting in hundreds of thousands of
people being killed. This purge was due to mistrust and political differences, as well as the massive
drop in grain produce. This was due to the method of collectivization in Russia. The Soviet Union
produced 16 million lbs of grain less in 1934 compared to 1930. This led to the starvation of millions of
Russians.
The Abdication of Edward VIII in 1936, gives the British Crown to George VI, 325 days after the death
of his father George V. The Coronation of George VI and Elizabeth takes place in May 1937.

The 1937 World's Fair in Paris displays the growing political tensions in Europe. The pavilions of the
rival countries of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union face each other. Germany at the time was
internationally condemned for Luftwaffe (its air force) having performed a bombing of the Basque town
of Guernica in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Spanish artist Pablo Picasso depicted the bombing
in his masterpiece painting Guernica at the World Fair, which was a surrealist depiction of the horror
of the bombing.
Referendum in the Irish Free State in December 1937 on whether Ireland should continue to be a
constitutional monarchy under King George VI or to become a republic results in citizens voting in
favour of a republic, ending the remains of British sovereignty through monarchial authority over the

British possession and also increasing the political autonomy of the remaining presidencies and
provinces of British India.

Mao Zedong's Chinese communists begin a large retreat from advancing nationalist forces, called the
Long March, beginning in October 1934 and ending in October 1936 and resulting in the collapse of
the Chinese Soviet Republic.
Colonial India's Muslim League leader Muhammed Ali Jinnah
delivers his "Day of Deliverance" speech on December 2, 1939,
calling upon Muslims to begin to engage in civil disobedience
against the British colonial government starting on December 12.
Jinnah demands redress and resolution to tensions and violence
occurring between Muslims and Hindus in India. Jinnah's actions
are not supported by the largely Hindu-dominated Indian National
Congress whom he had previously closely allied with. The
decision is seen as part of an agenda by Jinnah to support the
Japanese march into
eventual creation of an independent Muslim state called Pakistan

few residual exceptions. The Parliament of Australia and Parliament of New Zealand gain full
legislative authority over their territories, no longer sharing powers with the Parliament of the United
Kingdom.

disasters ever recorded.
The 1935 Labor Day Hurricane makes landfall in the Florida Keys
as a Category 5 hurricane and the most intense hurricane to ever
make landfall in the Atlantic basin. It caused an estimated $6
million (1935 USD) in damages and killed around 408 people. The
hurricane's strong winds and storm surge destroyed nearly all of
the structures between Tavernier and Marathon, and the town of
Islamorada was obliterated.

The Dust Bowl, or "Dirty Thirties", a period of severe dust storms causing major ecological and
agricultural damage to American and Canadian prairie lands from 1930 to 1936 (in some areas until
1940). Caused by extreme drought coupled with strong winds and decades of extensive farming
without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops, or other techniques to prevent erosion, it affected an

estimated 100,000,000 acres (400,000 km2) of land (traveling as far east as New York and the Atlantic
Ocean), caused mass migration (which was the inspiration for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The
Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck), food shortages, multiple deaths and illness from sand inhalation
(see History in Motion (http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/himdustbowl.htm)), and a severe
reduction in the going wage rate.

Yugoslavia.[7]
Sergei Kirov, an early Bolshevik revolutionary and personal friend to
Joseph Stalin, is assassinated in 1934, escalating political repression in the Soviet Union.

Economics
The Great Depression is considered to have begun with the fall of
stock prices on September 4, 1929, and then the stock market
crash known as Black Tuesday on October 29, 1929, and lasted
through much of the 1930s.
The entire decade is marked by widespread unemployment and
poverty, although deflation (i.e. falling prices) was limited to 1930–
32 and 1938–39. Prices fell 7.02% in 1930, 10.06% in 1931,
9.79% in 1932, 1.41% in 1938 and 0.71% in 1939.[8]

Sam Goldwyn at a cost of $1 million, the picture was an adaptation of a smash musical comedy
built around Eddie Cantor...A personality-centered musical, Whoopee! made little attempt to
integrate the comedy routines, songs, and story. Nonetheless, Cantor's feature-film debut grossed
over $2.6 million worldwide and started a popular series that included Palmy Days (1931), The Kid
from Spain (1932), and Roman Scandals (1933)."

Balio, Tino (1976). United Artists: The Company Built by the Stars. University of Wisconsin Press.
p. 110 (https://books.google.com/books?id=QljKdIYzncoC&pg=PA110). "Hughes did not have the
"Midas touch" the trade press so often attributed to him. Variety, for example, reported that Hell's
Angels cost $3.2 million to make, and by July, 1931, eight months after its release, the production
cost had nearly been paid off. Keats claimed the picture cost $4 million to make and that it earned
twice that much within twenty years. The production cost estimate is probably correct. Hughes
worked on the picture for over two years, shooting it first as a silent and then as a talkie. Lewis
Milestone said that in between Hughes experimented with shooting it in color as well. But Variety's
earnings report must be the fabrication of a delirious publicity agent, and Keats' the working of a
myth maker. During the seven years it was in United Artists distribution, Hell's Angels grossed
$1.6 million in the domestic market, of which Hughes' share was $1.2 million. Whatever the foreign
gross was, it seems unlikely that it was great enough to earn a profit for the picture."

playoff in the rest of the country's theaters. Griffith had originally placed the potential film rental at
$3,000,000 but, because of the success of the various roadshows that were running the

its foreign grosses followed the usual 40 percent of domestic returns, the film would have lost
