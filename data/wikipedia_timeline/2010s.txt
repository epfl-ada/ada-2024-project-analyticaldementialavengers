2010s
The 2010s (pronounced "twenty-tens" or "two thousand [and]
tens"), variously nicknamed "the '10s" ["the Tens"], "the
Tenties", or more rarely "the Teens"), was a decade that began
on January 1, 2010, and ended on December 31, 2019.
The decade began with an economic recovery from the Great
Recession. Inflation and interest rates stayed low and steady
throughout the decade, gross world product grew from 2010 to
2019. Global economic recovery accelerated during the latter
half of the decade, fueled by strong economic growth in many
countries, robust consumer spending, increased investment in
infrastructure, and the emergence of new technologies. However,
the recovery developed unevenly. Socioeconomic crises in some
countries—particularly in the Arab world—triggered political
revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Bahrain as well as civil wars
in Libya, Syria, and Yemen in a regional phenomenon that was
commonly referred to as the Arab Spring. Meanwhile, Europe
had to grapple with a debt crisis that was pronounced early in the
decade. Shifting social attitudes saw LGBT rights make
substantial progress throughout the decade, particularly in
developed countries.

From top left, clockwise: Anti-government protests
called the Arab Spring arose in 2010–2011, and as a
result, many governments were overthrown, including
when Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was killed;
Crimea is annexed by Russia in 2014; ISIS/ISIL
perpetrates terrorist attacks and captures territory in
Syria and Iraq; climate change awareness and the
Paris Agreement; the Event Horizon Telescope
captures the first image of a black hole in 2019;
Obergefell v. Hodges legalizes same-sex marriage in
the United States in 2015, marking continuing progress
for LGBT rights in developed countries; increasing use
of digital media and rise of mobile devices; the UK
votes to leave the EU in 2016 on a rising tide of
populism throughout the decade.

The decade saw the musical and cultural dominance of dancepop, electronic dance music, hipster culture and electropop.
Globalization and an increased demand for variety and
personalisation in the face of music streaming services such as
Spotify, SoundCloud and Apple Music created many musical
subgenres. As the decade progressed, diversity was also seen
with the mainstream success of K-pop, Latin music and trap.
Superhero films became box office leaders, with Avengers:
Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film of all time.[note 1]
Cable providers saw a decline in subscribers as cord cutters
switched to lower cost online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney+. The video game
industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft; while indie games became more popular, with
Minecraft becoming the best-selling game of all time. Handheld console gaming revenue was overtaken by mobile
gaming revenue in 2011. The best-selling book of this decade was Fifty Shades of Grey. Drake was named the top music
artist of the decade in the U.S. by Billboard.[note 2]
The United States continued to retain its superpower status while China sought to expand its influence in the South China
Sea and in Africa through its economic initiatives and military reforms. It solidified its position as an emerging
superpower, despite causing a series of conflicts around its frontiers. Within its border, China enhanced its suppression
and control of Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet. These developments led the United States to implement a containment
policy and initiate a trade war against China. Elsewhere in Asia, the Koreas improved their relations after a prolonged
crisis between the two countries, and the War on Terror continued as a part of the U.S.'s continued military involvement in
many parts of the world. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant extremist organization in 2014 erased the
Syria-Iraq border, resulting in a multinational intervention against it. In Africa, South Sudan broke away from Sudan, and
mass protests and various coups d'état saw longtime strongmen deposed. In the U.S., celebrity businessman Donald
Trump was elected president amid an international wave of populism and neo-nationalism. The European Union
experienced a migrant crisis in the middle of the decade and withdrawal of the United Kingdom as a member state

following the historic United Kingdom EU membership referendum. Russia attempted to assert itself in international
affairs, annexing Crimea in 2014. In the last months of the decade, the first cases of the Coronavirus pandemic of SarsCov2 emerged in Wuhan, China, before affecting the rest of the world.
Information technology progressed, with smartphones becoming widespread and increasingly displacing desktop
computers for many users. Internet coverage grew from 29% to 54% of the world population, and also saw advancements
in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and cloud computing. Advancements in data processing and the rollout
of 4G broadband allowed data, metadata, and information to be collected and dispersed among domains at paces never
before seen while online resources such as social media facilitated phenomena such as the Me Too movement, the rise of
slacktivism, and online cancel culture. WikiLeaks gained international attention for publishing classified information on
topics related to Guantánamo Bay, Syria, the Afghan and Iraq wars, and United States diplomacy. Edward Snowden blew
the whistle on global surveillance, raising awareness on the role governments and private entities play in global
surveillance and information privacy. Baidu (4th), Twitter (6th) and Instagram (8th) emerged to become among the top 10
most visited websites, while Wikipedia went from the 9th to the 5th most popular website, almost sextupling its monthly
visits. Yahoo significantly declined in popularity, descending from being the 1st to the 9th most popular site, with monthly
visits declining by two-thirds. Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yandex maintained relatively consistent popularity and
remained within the top 10 throughout the decade.
Global warming became increasingly noticeable through new record temperatures in different occurrences and extreme
weather events on all continents. The CO2 concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM over the decade. At the same time,
combating pollution and climate change continued to be areas of major concern, as protests, initiatives, and legislation
garnered substantial media attention. The Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, and the global climate youth movement
was formed. Major natural disasters included the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the
Nepal earthquake of 2015, the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami, the devastating tropical cyclones Bopha (Pablo),
Haiyan (Yolanda), and Maria, as well as the 2019 European heat waves.
During the decade, the world population grew from 6.9 to 7.7 billion people. There were approximately 1.4 billion births
during the decade (140 million per year), and about 560 million deaths (56 million per year).[3]

Conflict between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel and
the West Bank has been ongoing since 1948.[7] After Israel
occupied the West Bank, it began making settlements there,
which has been an obstacle to the peace process.[8] Tensions
also remained high as Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip,
has been launching rockets and cross-border raids into Israeli
territory, to which Israel has responded with force.[9]
The region of Karabakh has been disputed over the Republic
of Artsakh, which is supported by the Armenian government.
A ceasefire was held in 1994. From April 1–5, 2016, clashes
began along the Nagorno-Karabakh line of contact with the
Artsakh Defence Army, backed by the Armenian Armed
Forces on one side and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces on the
other. A ceasefire was reached on 5 April between Azerbaijan
and Armenia in Moscow. From May 20–27, 2018, clashes in
former no man's land[10] in the Nakhchivan Autonomous
Republic, an exclave of Azerbaijan, led to Azerbaijan
reoccupying Günnüt and several other strategic villages and
positions.[11][12]

Motivated by the September 11 attacks, the United States
and other governments started a large scale effort to
eliminate terrorism.[13] With support from NATO, the United
States invaded Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and overthrew
the government.[14] Two years later, on the pretext that the
government of Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass
destruction,[15] the United States and a coalition of partners
invaded Iraq and overthrew Hussein,[16] after which the U.S.
occupied the country.[17] However, insurgencies remained
active in both countries, long after the invasions.[18]

Following United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, a
NATO-led coalition launched an air campaign backing antiGaddafi rebels against Muammar Gaddafi's government in
the Libyan Civil War.
After the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych,
Russian soldiers took control of strategic positions in the
Ukrainian territory of Crimea and subsequently annexed the
region after a controversial referendum.[19] In the months that
followed, demonstrations in Donbas escalated into an armed
conflict between the government of Ukraine and Russianbacked separatist forces. On 24 February 2022, it concluded
with the Russian invasion of Ukraine
In late 2013, a terrorist organisation called the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant began making rapid advances and
territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. It captured Mosul in June[20]
and made Raqqa its capital.[21] Various international
coalitions led by the United States, France, Russia, and
Muslim states and with aid from dozens of countries were
formed to help fight the militants.[22][23] By December 2017,
ISIL had lost all of its territory in Iraq and 95% of its territory in
Syria,[24] and was militarily and territorially defeated on 23
March 2019.[25]
During the Yemeni Civil War, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, and other countries invaded parts of Yemen in order
to depose the Houthi-controlled government.

controversial reaction worldwide in response to reported
human rights violations[30][31][32] and resettlement of Kurds
which has been viewed as possible ethnic cleansing.[33][34][35]

Pakistani militant group that took responsibility for the
bombing and the purported target of Indian attacks.

27 May 1964

Low-intensity conflict between the Colombian government,
left-wing guerrillas, and paramilitary factions has been
ongoing since 1964. However, at the start of the decade, only
two major groups remained, FARC and ELN.[38] Since 2012,
both have been in peace talks with the government, with
FARC and the government signing a historic ceasefire in June
2016.[39] Though the deal was initially rejected by voters in
October,[40] a revised deal was unanimously passed by the
Congress in November 2016, bringing an end to much of the
fighting.[41][42]

16 March 2004

Since 2004, Pakistan has been fighting an insurgency by
armed militant groups aligned with the Taliban or Islamic State
along its border with Afghanistan.[43] The violence has killed
at least 60,000 since[44] and over 6 million displaced.[45][46][47]
By 2014, however, casualties from terrorist and militant
attacks had dropped by around 40%.[48][49]

27 August 2005

Since 2005, Paraguay has been fighting a low-level
insurgency by Marxist–Leninist[50] armed militant groups.[51]
The conflict is estimated to have caused a cumulative 111
deaths by 2020, most of which have been insurgents, local
ranchers, and police officers.[51]

11 December
2006

Following a rise in criminal violence as a result of influential
drug trafficking in the country, President Felipe Calderón
declared a war on drugs in 2006.[52] Since then, violence has
sharply increased,[53] with a death toll of nearly 300,000[54]
over 60,000 missing, and 39,000 unidentified bodies in
morgues.[55] Arrests of cartel leaders led to increasing
violence as cartels,[56][57] fought for control of trafficking
routes into the United States.[58][59][60] The conflict has
emphasised corruption and human rights abuses, with
bribery, drug smuggling, kidnapping, and protection of cartels
being widely reported among government officials.[56][61]

31 January 2009

In 2009, Al-Shabaab, an Islamist militant group, began
waging an insurgency against the newly formed Transitional
Federal Government. In 2011, the federal government
captured Mogadishu[62] and subsequently retook towns
across the country.[63] Since then, the government has
attempted to clean out the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds
with help from AMISOM soldiers[64] and military intervention
on the part of the United States. Al-Shabaab made a
resurgence in 2016, when AMISOM and Kenyan forces were
subject to attacks and raids,[65] to which American and Somali
forces responded with airstrikes,[66][67] weakening Al
Shabaab's territorial prominence. The conflict has cost
300,000 to 500,000 lives and devastated Somalia's
infrastructure and humanitarian resources.[68][69]

Boko Haram
insurgency

26 July 2009

Sparked by long-standing conflict between Nigeria's Christian
and Muslim communities, the Boko Haram insurgency began
when the jihadist rebel group started a rebellion against the
government.[70] In 2015, the group pledged alliance to
ISIL,[71] becoming the world's deadliest terrorist group by
2015.[72][73] The conflict has killed over 37,500 people and
displaced 2.5 million, driving 244,000 Nigerian refugees into
neighbouring states.[74] Insurgents were weakened in 2015
when Nigerian forces drove them into Sambisa Forest,[75]
causing bitter infighting.[76] However, they made a resurgence
in 2018–19, with human rights violations; massacres; and
mass child kidnappings, exploitation, and torture posing a
threat to civilians.[77][78][79][80]

the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.[85]

9 December 2017

The civil war began with the conquest of Fallujah, Mosul, Tikrit
and areas of northern Iraq by Islamic State. Nations provided
aid in the form of airstrikes, troops and intelligence.[86][87] In
December 2017, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced
victory over ISIL,[88] though others warned to expect ISIL to
continue the fight by other means.[89]

24 October 2020

Following the factional violence that engulfed Libya after the
fall of Muammar Gaddafi, a second civil war broke out among
factions seeking control of the territory and oil of Libya. The
conflict was mostly between the House of Representatives
(HoR) government that was controversially elected in 2014,
also known as the "Tobruk government"; and the rival General
National Congress (GNC) government, also called the
"National Salvation Government". A permanent ceasefire
agreement in all areas became effective from October 2020,
ending the war.[90][91]

23 May 2017

The battle of Marawi was a five-month-long armed conflict in
Marawi, Philippines, that started on May 23, 2017, between
Philippine government security forces against militants
affiliated with the Islamic State, including the Maute and Abu
Sayyaf Salafi jihadist groups. The battle became the longest
urban battle in the modern history of the Philippines.

23 October 2017

9 September 2017

Following the suppression of 2016–17 protests by
Cameroonian authorities, Ambazonian separatists in the
Anglophone regions launched a guerrilla campaign against
the Cameroon Armed Forces, and unilaterally proclaimed
independence. In November 2017, the government of
Cameroon declared war on the separatists and sent its army
into the Anglophone regions.

5 October 2017

The insurgency in Cabo Delgado is an ongoing Islamist
insurgency in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, fought
between militant Islamists and jihadists attempting to
establish an Islamic state, and Mozambican security forces.
Civilians have been the main targets of terrorist attacks by
Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar alSunna, a native extremist faction with connections to ISIS.

Preceded by a decade-long Houthi insurgency,[92] the Yemeni
Civil War began between two factions: the then-incumbent
Yemeni government and the Houthi militia, along with their
supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the Yemeni
government.[93]

9 December 2017

The insurgency in Iraq is an ongoing low-intensity insurgency
that began in 2017 after ISIS lost its territorial control in the
War in Iraq, during which ISIS and allied White Flags fought
the Iraqi military (largely backed by the United States, United
Kingdom and other countries conducting airstrikes against
ISIS) and allied paramilitary forces (largely backed by Iran).

January 2018

The Catatumbo campaign has been an ongoing period of
violence between militia faction groups in the Catatumbo
region of Colombia and Venezuela since January 2018. It is
an extension of the War on drugs and developed after the
Colombian peace process of 2016.

Arab Spring
The Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the
Islamic world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living, starting with
protests in Tunisia.[115][116] Social media was heralded as the driving force behind the swift spread of revolution
throughout the world, as new protests appeared in response to success stories shared from those taking place in other
countries. Many governments began recognising the importance of social media for citizens to organise and began
shutting down certain websites or blocking Internet service entirely, especially prior to major rallies.[117] Governments
also scrutinised or suppressed discussion in online forums through accusing content creators of unrelated crimes or
shutting down communication on specific sites or groups, such as through Facebook.[118]

Facing protests against his 42-year rule, Muammar Gaddafi refused to step
down and sent in the military to brutally quell protests.[121][122] As a result,
many army units defected to the opposition and protests soon turned into an
armed rebellion.[123] With international help, the rebels captured Tripoli,[124]
and eventually Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown and last outpost, where he was
killed.[125]
Protests erupted in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad's rule, with police
and the army sent in to crack down on protesters.[126][127] They later morphed
into war after army officers defected to the opposition, forming the Free Syrian
Army (FSA).[128] It led to the Kurdish parties called the SDF to secede from
Northeastern Syria, forming Rojava. The war also allowed for Islamic extremist
groups like Al-Nusra Front and ISIL to temporarily take control of vast amounts
of territory.

The Arab Spring saw mass unrest in the Arab world early
in the decade:

Nuclear proliferation
On 8 April 2010, the United States and Russia signed a treaty in
Prague, Czech Republic agreed to reduce the stockpiles of their
nuclear weapons by half. It is meant to replace the Strategic Offensive
Reductions Treaty (SORT), which was set to expire.[129] The treaty
went into force on 5 February 2011 after it was ratified by both
nations.[130]
P5+1 and Iranian negotiators
In 2015, Iran and other world powers agreed to trade sanctions relief for
meeting in Geneva for the interim
explicit constraints on Iran's contentious nuclear program, including
agreement on the Iranian nuclear
allowing the inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic
[131]
programme (2013)
Energy Agency (IAEA).
On 16 January 2016 the IAEA confirmed
that Iran had complied with the agreement (the JCPOA), allowing the
United Nations to lift sanctions immediately.[132][133] However, on 8 May
2018, United States President Donald Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from the
deal.[134]

On 7 July 2017, the United Nations passed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the first
legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of
leading towards their total elimination.[135][136] It has been signed by 58 nations.[137]
Throughout the decade, North Korea expanded its nuclear capabilities, performing alleged nuclear tests in
2013[138] and 2016,[139] which governments responded by placing international sanctions on the
country.[140][141] In response North Korea has threatened the United States, South Korea and Japan with
pre-emptive nuclear strikes.[142] However, in 2018, North Korea suggested that they may disarm their
nuclear arsenal after negotiations with the United States.
On 1 February 2019, The US formally suspended the Russo-American Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty (INF),[143] and Russia did the same on the following day in response. The US formally withdrew
from the treaty on 2 August 2019.[144]
The United States initiated a renovation of its nuclear weapon arsenal.

Political trends
International relations
China was increasingly called a superpower in the early 2010s, including at the
2011 meeting between President Hu Jintao and United States President Barack
Obama. By the end of the decade, China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest
trading nation and the country filing the most patents, dramatically expanded its
military and landed its lunar rover Yutu on the moon, ending a four-decade hiatus
of lunar exploration. In 2018, global military spending reached its highest level
since 1988, late Cold War levels, largely fuelled by increased defence spending by
the United States (4.6% increase to $649 billion) and China (5% increase to $250
billion). Together, their budgets accounted for half of the world's total military
spending.[189] In 2019, the Lowy Institute Asia Power Index, which measures the
projections of power across eight indexes in the Indo-Pacific, ranked the United
States at #1 with a score of 84.5 and China #2 with a score of 75.9.[190]

BRICS, a supranational economic
cooperative comprising five major
emerging national economies—
Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa—grew to represent
over 3.1 billion people, or about 41
percent of the world population by
2015.

Along with the United States and China, Russia under President Vladimir Putin
steadily increased its defence spending and continued to modernise its military
throughout the decade. This included the development of the T-14 Armata main
battle tank and the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 jet fighter. Russia also exercised its power projection capabilities in its

2014 annexation of Crimea and interventions in eastern Ukraine and the Syrian Civil War. Russia also waged information
warfare campaigns against its geopolitical foes, interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections via hacking and leaking emails of
U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the Internet Research Agency. Other alleged Russian
intelligence operations included the Skripal poisonings and the Montenegrin coup plot, both of which were attributed by
some to the GRU's Unit 29155. Collectively, these activities—and the Western-led efforts to combat them—have been
referred to as marking the beginning of the Second Cold War.
The European Union went through several crises. The European debt crisis caused severe economic problems to several
eurozone member states, most notably Greece. The 2015 migration crisis led to several million people entering the EU
illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several eurosceptic parties, including
the League in Italy, Alternative for Germany, and the Finns Party in Finland. As a result of a referendum, the United
Kingdom became the first member state in the EU's history to leave the Union.
Western polarisation
Socio-political polarisation increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and
other social, economic and environmental issues in the West. In the United States, polls showed a divided electorate
regarding healthcare reform, immigration, gun rights, taxation, job creation, and debt reduction.[191] In Europe,
movements protesting increasing numbers of refugees and migrants from Islamic countries developed, such as the English
Defence League and Pegida.[192][193] The trend of polarisation in the West was partially influenced by the prevalence of
identity politics, both left-wing and right-wing, among activist movements.[194] Beginning around 2011, far-left and
progressive concepts such as combating social inequality and economic inequality, often via progressive stack tactics,
proliferated in the Western world and elsewhere.[195][196][197] Around the middle of the decade, phenomenon such as
white nationalism, identitarianism and emboldened feelings of nativism saw a marked reemergence in the West due to
drastically increased migration and corresponding crime and amongst both the right and left general dissatisfaction with
Western government and Media responses to certain issues.[198] There were also increased calls for egalitarianism,
including between the sexes,[199] and some scholars assert that a fourth wave of feminism began around 2012, with a
primary focus on intersectionality.[200][201]
Anti-establishment politics
Populism in politics saw a widespread surge throughout the decade, with many
politicians and various political movements expressing populist sentiments and
utilising populist rhetoric.[202][203] This included conservative wave phenomenon
in Latin America and neo-nationalist fervor in Europe and North America. The
2019 European Parliament election saw the highest voter turnout in two decades
and saw relatively moderate centre-right and centre-left parties suffer significant
losses to less moderate far-right, environmentalist, and both pro-EU and
eurosceptic parties, who made gains.[204] Examples of 2010s populist movements
included the Tea Party movement,[205] Occupy Wall Street,[206] Brexit,[207] Black
Lives Matter,[208] and the alt-right.[209][210] Examples of populist country leaders
were just as extensive, with Donald Trump,[211] Narendra Modi,[212] Andrés
Manuel López Obrador,[213] Hugo Chávez,[214] Matteo Salvini,[215] Jair
Bolsonaro,[216] Rodrigo Duterte,[217] Boris Johnson, and Alexis Tsipras left and
right-wing, described as such.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro
and United States President Donald
Trump in 2019. Both are emblematic
of a wave of neo-nationalist and
globalisation-weary conservative
populism in the second half of the
decade.

Related to the rise of populism and protests movements was the decline of traditional political parties. In Europe,
pasokification described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional centre-left or social democratic parties. In
France, specifically, Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche! party won a majority in its first election in 2017.
Centre-left, neoliberal and traditional social democratic parties often lost their vote share to more socialist or democratic
socialist alternatives, especially in Europe. This happened most completely in Greece, where PASOK was replaced by
Syriza as the main left-wing party. Other far-left parties which rose in prominence included Podemos in Spain and La

France Insoumise in France. In the two-party systems of the English-speaking world, these challenges mainly came from
within the established parties of the left, with Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party and Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour
Party pushing for more left-wing policies.
The political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new
social media platforms. These included the various Arab Spring protests, the Occupy movement, and the yellow vests
movement.
Democractisation and authoritarianism
Countries which democratised fully or partially during the decade included Angola, which
reformed under João Lourenço;[218] Armenia, which went through a revolution;[218][219]
Ecuador, which reformed under Lenín Moreno;[218] Ethiopia;[218][219] and Malaysia,
where the ruling party lost the first election since independence.[218][220]
Long-term dictators ousted from power included Muammar Gaddafi of Libya (after 42
years),[221] Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe (37 years),[222] Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen (33
years),[223] Omar al-Bashir of Sudan (30 years),[224] Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (29
years),[225] and Ben Ali of Tunisia (23 years).[226]
The Arab Winter refers to the resurgence of authoritarianism, absolute monarchies and
Islamic extremism[227] evolving in the aftermath of the Arab Spring protests in Arab
Xi Jinping became China's
countries.[228] The term "Arab Winter" refers to the events across Arab League countries in
leader for life in 2018.
the Mid-East and North Africa, including the Syrian Civil War,[229][230] the Iraqi
insurgency and the following civil war,[231] the Egyptian Crisis,[232] the Libyan Crisis and
the Crisis in Yemen.[233] Events referred to as the Arab Winter include those in Egypt that led to the removal of Mohamed
Morsi and the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood campaign.[234]
Democratic backsliding also occurred in countries such as Hungary,[235] Venezuela,[236] and Turkey.[237]
In 2018, China's National People's Congress approved a constitutional change that removed term limits for its leaders,
granting Xi Jinping the status of "leader for life". Xi is the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (de facto
leader).
Deaths
Sitting world leaders such as Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, Kim Jong-il of North Korea,
Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Lech Kaczyński of Poland, Zillur Rahman of Bangladesh, Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan and
Beji Caid Essebsi of Tunisia, all died in office, as did former leaders Fidel Castro, Lee Kuan Yew, Nelson Mandela,
Margaret Thatcher, Robert Mugabe, Giulio Andreotti, Francesco Cossiga, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
Jacques Chirac, Helmut Schmidt, Helmut Kohl, Hussain Mohammad Ershad, Mohamed Morsi, Ariel Sharon, Shimon

Economics
The global economy during the 2010s was generally strong. It saw steady growth,
low unemployment, and increasing consumer confidence recovering from the great
recession. The decade ended with a strong finish, with 2019 seeing record highs in
many areas. A sovereign-debt crisis in Europe began in early 2010, and the Greek
government admitted that it was having difficulties servicing its large sovereign
debt. In the summer and fall of 2011, bond yields for Italy and Spain spiked above
6 percent.[485] By 2015 bond rates had returned to normal ranges across Europe,
save for Greece, which accepted another, even more stringent bailout package. The
size of the European Financial Stability Facility was increased from €440 billion to
€2 trillion.[486] Despite the Eurozone debt crisis, the American Dow Jones
Industrial Average had its longest stretch of gains since the late 1990s tech
boom.[487] However, economic issues, including inflation and an increase in
commodity prices, sparked unrest in many lower-income countries. In some
countries, particularly those in the Arab world, political unrest evolved into
socioeconomic crises, resulting in the Arab Spring leading to political instability
and civil wars.
As a result of the global recession, many central banks instituted a zero interestrate policy, or close to it.[488] Another form of monetary stimulus was that of
quantitative easing. The resulting flood of market liquidity caused a rise in asset
prices.[489] As a result, for example, United States stock prices reached record
highs.[490] Another consequence has been the rise in housing prices in many major
world cities.[491] Some of the cities which recorded the most dramatic rises
included Sydney, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Auckland.[492]

August 2011, the S&P downgraded the United States' credit rating from triple AAA to AA-plus following a debt ceiling
crisis.[495] Also in 2011, a Gallup poll found that more than half of Americans believed the country was still in a
recession.[496] In June 2015, the Shanghai Stock Exchange lost a third of the value of A-shares within one month, an event
known as the 2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence. India became the fastest growing major economy of the world in
2015, surpassing China.[497] In 2018, as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates, fears of a yield curve inversion
preceding a potential U.S. recession sent inflation higher in several emerging markets, including Argentina, where interest
rates hit 40% and an International Monetary Fund bail out was issued.[498] In 2019, Singapore supplanted the United
States as the world's most competitive economy, with the U.S. dropping to third, behind Hong Kong.[499]
Global oil production in 2014 reached a historic peak, reaching 93 million barrels/day.[500] In 2018, partially due to a
shale boom, the United States overcame Russia and Saudi Arabia in becoming the world's largest crude oil producer, the
first time since 1973.[501] Around the year 2017 is a period seen by some economists as being the new peak of a

"goldilocks economy".[502] The International Monetary Fund's April 2019 World
Economic Outlook stated, "After peaking at close to 4 percent in 2017, global
[economic] growth remained strong, at 3.8 percent in the first half of 2018, but
dropped to 3.2 percent in the second half of the year."[503]
In 2018, United States President Donald Trump announced he would put into place
new tariffs on some Chinese products, starting the 'US-China Trade War', an
economic conflict involving the world's two largest economies. Trump said the
reasoning for the trade war was to punish China for "unfair" trade practices, such
as the appropriation of jobs and the theft of American intellectual property. China
responded with tariffs of its own, and a cycle began, escalating the conflict. As part
of his 'America First' policy, Trump also announced new tariffs were being placed
on countries around the world for various products such as steel and aluminium,
which also drew some economic retaliation from traditional U.S. trade partners.

drone delivery and transformed
parts of the services and retail
sectors

By the end of the decade, in North American and some Western European domestic
economies, consumer-level purchasing habits had shifted significantly, a partial
consequence of the Great Recession's impact on discretionary incomes and a shifting
breadwinner model. The so-called "retail apocalypse" had commenced as consumers
increasingly resorted to online shopping and e-commerce, accelerating the decline of
brick-and-mortar retail and the continued decline of indoor shopping malls. The
transitioning retail industry and popularity of online shopping facilitated economic
phenomena such as bricks and clicks business models, pop-up and non-store retailing,
drone delivery services, ghost restaurants, and a quickly maturing online food ordering and
delivery service sector.[504][505] This was only further perpetuated by the rise in
cryptocurrency throughout the decade, such as Bitcoin. By May 2018, over 1,800
cryptocurrency specifications existed.[506]
In the same vein as cryptocurrency, the trend towards a cashless society continued as noncash transactions and digital currency saw an increase in favourability in the 2010s. By
2016, only about 2 percent of the value transacted in Sweden was by cash, and only about
20 percent of retail transactions were in cash. Fewer than half of bank branches in the
country conducted cash transactions.[507] A report published in 2019 suggested that the
percentage of payments conducted in cash in the United Kingdom had fallen to 34% from
63% from 2009.[508] The 2016 United States User Consumer Survey Study claimed that 75
percent of respondents preferred a credit card or debit card as their payment method while
only 11 percent of respondents preferred cash.[509]

Science and technology
Two of the most prominent deaths in the scientific community during the decade were Neil
Armstrong in 2012 and Stephen Hawking in 2018.

In 2014 the One World
Trade Center opened its
doors in the Financial
District of Manhattan,
serving as a replacement to
the original World Trade
Center Twin Towers that
were destroyed in 2001. On
the 10th anniversary of 9/11
in 2011 (the same year
Osama bin Laden was
killed), the 9/11 Memorial
was opened.

Below are the most significant scientific developments of each year, based on the annual
Breakthrough of the Year award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science journal Science.

2018: Development cell by cell[518]
2019: First black hole image released[519][520]

Technology
The late 2000s saw the rise of two prominent mobile operating systems, Android developed by Google and iOS developed
by Apple.
Robotics, particularly drones like quadcopters, experienced a wide use and application in
the 2010s. Autonomous and electric car technology and sales showed considerable growth
as well. In addition, sustainable space launch technologies were spearheaded by
entrepreneurs like Elon Musk.
In 2016, the number of people globally using mobile devices to access the internet
overtook those using desktop computers for the first time, having been preceded by the
U.S. two years prior in 2014.[521][522][523][524][525] 3D printers also emerged in the 2010s
and were referenced or used in pop culture during the decade.
In 2018, during the Falcon Heavy test flight, the first production car was launched into
space. The car was attached to the Falcon Heavy rocket, the most powerful rocket in
operation at the time.

NSA employee who
revealed a large number of
global surveillance
programs.

Event

Date

Description

25 July 2010

U.S. military logs of the War in Afghanistan. The
documents revealed numerous cover-ups and
absence of trials for captured or killed Taliban
members by the coalition.[526]

August 2010

A malicious computer worm was responsible for
causing substantial damage to Iran's nuclear
program. Although neither country has admitted
responsibility, the worm is now generally
acknowledged to be a jointly built U.S.-Israeli
cyberweapon.[527]

22 October 2010

WikiLeaks disclosed nearly 392,000 U.S. Army
field reports of the Iraq War, the largest leak in
the history of the U.S. military. It documented
multiple cases of misconduct, abuse of power
against civilians and other war crimes by U.S.
authorities in the country.[528]

April 2013

A report disclosed details of 130,000 offshore
accounts, with some observers calling it one of
the biggest hit against international tax fraud of
all time. The report originated from the
Washington D.C. investigative journalism
nonprofit, the International Consortium of
Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).[529]

Edward Snowden leaked files through the
Guardian newspaper detailing National Security
Agency (NSA) privacy policies, including PRISM,
the NSA call database, and Boundless
Informant.[530]

5 June 2015

The Office of Personnel Management of the U.S.
government announced that it was hacked,
resulting in a massive data breach, stealing
information of around 21.5 million people.[531]
The attack was suspected to have originated
from China but it remains unclear if it was or
not.[532]

4 February 2016

The Bangladesh Bank became a victim of theft
after hackers attempted to steal US$951 Million
from its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.[533] The hackers failed to steal the
attempted amount but still got away with $81
million, which was diverted to the Philippines,
making it one of the largest bank heists in
history.[534]

3 April 2016

11.5 million confidential documents were leaked
from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca
that detailed financial and attorney–client
information of more than 214,488 offshore

Fonseca, which shut down
in light of revelations from
the Panama Papers.

and PayPal. The Department of Homeland Security opens an investigation.[537]

WannaCry
ransomware attack

Paradise Papers

12 May 2017

A large cyberattack infected more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries,
demanding ransom payments in the cryptocurrency bitcoin in 28 languages. The
attack spread by multiple methods, including phishing emails and on unpatched
systems as a computer worm. The attack was described by Europol as
unprecedented in scale, affecting large companies such as Telefónica and parts of
Britain's National Health Service.[538]

5 November 2017

A set of 13.4 million confidential electronic documents relating to offshore
investments. The documents originate from the offshore law firm Appleby, the
corporate services providers Estera and Asiaciti Trust, and business registries in 19
tax jurisdictions. At 1.4 terabytes in size, this is second only to the Panama Papers,
it is the second biggest data leak in history.[539]

Health and society
AIDS, a pandemic responsible for killing over 30 million people since its discovery in the early 1980s, especially in subSaharan Africa, became a treatable condition, though by the end of the decade only two cases had been cured.[540] With
good treatment patients can generally expect normal lives and lifespans. However, as of 2011 only some 5 million of the
12 million affected people had access to such treatment.[541]
During the 2010s, social changes included increases in life expectancy and falling birth rates leading to larger proportions
of the population being elderly. This put pressure on pensions and other social security programs in developed nations.
The environment became a topic of greater public concern around the world.[542] Many parts of the world moved towards

greater acceptance of LGBT people often including the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The internet took an ever
greater role in entertainment, communication, politics and commerce, especially for younger people and those living in
wealthier countries. In 2011, the world population reached seven billion people.[543]

Popular culture

Silly Bandz, a piece of pop
culture and fashion wear in the
early 2010s. They were often
traded and worn by school
children.

Disney, Pixar, and Illumination
led CGI films during the decade,
making some of the highestgrossing movies of all time like
Toy Story 3, Frozen, Incredibles
2 and Despicable Me. Other
studios released CGI films like
The Lego Movie and SpiderMan: Into The Spider-Verse.

The Big Bang Theory, which
was popular in the 2010s,
became the top sitcom
throughout its airing on CBS.
The show featured numerous
pop-culture figures from science
and tech, including Bill Gates,
Buzz Aldrin, and Elon Musk.

A young child spinning a fidget
spinner, one of the most popular
toys of the decade from spring
and summer of 2017, joining
novelty toys of the 2010s such
as the fidget cube.

The Nintendo 3DS, a portable
3D gaming device that
contained glasses-free 3D and
was released during the height
of the 3D fad in the 2010s. Its
flagship title was Super Mario
3D Land.

Smartphones and tablets
started to replace flip-phones
and become mainstream. They
could be used to play games,
make telephone calls, download
music, and check the Internet.
The iPad was first introduced in
2010 by Steve Jobs, who later
died in 2011.

The Wii (Wii Mini c. 2013
pictured) was a popular gaming
console in the 2010s which
influenced the Microsoft Kinect
and PlayStation Move. One of
the most critically acclaimed
games of the decade, Super
Mario Galaxy 2, released on the
Wii.

A cultural shift was that social
media heavily took over. For
really the first time in history, US
presidents like Barack Obama
and Donald Trump could
communicate directly to citizens
via applications like Facebook,
Twitter and Instagram.

A self-balancing scooter. These
devices (also named
hoverboards at the time)
attracted much attention and
curiosity around 2015 on the
Internet from appearing on
shows such as Jimmy Fallon
and Conan.

Fedora hats were popular at the
beginning of the 2010s, worn
here by Bruno Mars in 2011,
singer of "Uptown Funk" (the
Billboard Hot 100's #1 song of
the 2010s).

A public stop or "Pokéstop" for
the game Pokémon Go. The
game made use of AR, or
augmented reality, and became
huge in the summer of 2016.

Two men using cell phones
placed inside VR headsets in
2018. The same year Steven
Spielberg's Ready Player One
released, which featured Vive
Virtual Reality headsets and
helped advance motion capture.

The eighth generation of video
game consoles like PlayStation
4 (pictured), Xbox One, and
Nintendo Switch were released
in 2013 and 2017. These
systems popularized games like
The Last of Us, The Legend of
Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super
Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8,
Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto
V.

A cosplayer dressed as the
character Ramona Flowers from
the 2010 movie Scott Pilgrim vs.
the World, which helped
popularize the e-girl aesthetic
seen in the late 2010s.

In the late 2010s, vaping
became popular. Fruit-flavored
vape cartridges could be
purchased as well, and became
highly controversial.

Vaporwave was a 2010s music
genre that attracted attention.
Lofi hip hop was also new and
grew a following. Floral Shoppe
and Lofi Girl helped define these
genres of the 2010s.

A group of teens dabbing, a
popular fad and gesture of the
youth around 2015–2016.
Dabbing was the most
prominent dance trend of the
2010s, which joined such
dances as Flossing and the
Harlem Shake.

A group of emojis. The 2010s
saw the first usage of modern
emoticons or "emojis" which
were often on the operating
systems of phones and
computers.

With the infancy of mobile
gaming stores in the early
2010s, apps like Doodle Jump,
Angry Birds and Cut the Rope
became hits, with the success of
apps like Smash Hit and
Pokémon Go coming later on.

The EDM scene obtained
commercial success as seen
with songs like "Party Rock
Anthem" by LMFAO. The early
2010s had a unique party
culture that was inspired by
EDM.

In the 2010s indie artists gained
much wider traction online. A
few popular indie artists of the
decade included talents such as
Mitski (pictured), Gotye, Mac
DeMarco, Tame Impala, and
Foster the People.

Five Olympic Games were held
in the 2010s: Vancouver in
2010, London in 2012, Sochi in
2014, Rio de Janeiro in 2016
and Pyeongchang in 2018.

Internet
Internet users grew from covering 29% to 54% of the world population.[544]
Over the course of the 2010s, Baidu, Twitter and Instagram emerged to become among the top 10 most visited websites
(becoming the 4th, 6th and 8th most popular websites by the end of the decade), while Wikipedia went the 9th to 5th most
popular website, almost sextupling its monthly visits (from 1 to 5.7 billion). Meanwhile, Yahoo significantly declined in
popularity, descending from being the 1st to 9th most popular site, with monthly visits declining by two-thirds (going
from 11.6 to 3.9 billion). Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yandex maintained relatively consistent popularity and
remained within the top 10 throughout the decade.[545]


YouTube
The video streaming website YouTube became popular, especially among younger people, as memes shifted the meaning
of entertainment. Memes like Nyan Cat, Dat Boi, "We Are Number One", Trollface, Pepe the Frog, bottle flipping,
Condescending Wonka (Gene Wilder died in 2016), creepypastas and others emerged on YouTube; the use of YouTube
and the internet also lead to new and popular vernacular like: poggers, bae, Netflix and chill, and "on fleek".
Initially (early in the decade) channels like Fred Figglehorn (FRED), The Annoying Orange, Ray William Johnson,
CollegeHumor, Smosh, PewDiePie and the Angry Video Game Nerd attracted millions of views, channels and videos
becoming viral on the site. The popularity of YouTubers even ended up spawning films based on popular YouTubers,
including Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014), Smosh: The Movie (2015), and the Fred Trilogy (2010–2012)
starting with Fred: The Movie. These YouTubers became well known through comedic skits, video game reviews, and
"Let's Play" videos, as Angry Video Game Nerd reviewed games like Sonic The Hedgehog for the Xbox 360, and Life of
Black Tiger for the PlayStation 4, which AVGN reviewed in a video featuring Gilbert Gottfried, Smosh would upload skits
like "FOOD BATTLE" and Pewdiepie would play games such as Five Nights at Freddy's.[552][553]
Other YouTubers that constantly received views within the millions or went viral during the decade included the likes of
bill wurtz for his "history of japan" and "history of the entire world i guess" videos (and music like "and the day goes
on"), Swoozie, Etika (and his fanbase the "JOYCONBOYZ"), REACT, WatchMojo, The Joe Rogan Experience, The
Nostalgia Critic, Studio C, Babish Culinary Universe, Good Mythical Morning, Penguinz0, Vsauce, CGP Gray,
Kurzgesagt, Matpat, MrBeast, Scott the Woz, TheOdd1sOut, Domics, and Jaiden Animations among many others.
YouTube itself would even end up banning controversial content creators like ImJayStation and LeafyIsHere during the
decade.

YouTube would make an annual video series called YouTube Rewind where it would be a recap of each year's YouTubers,
viral videos, trends, events, music and memes starting from 2010 to 2019. The 2018 and 2019 installments was heavily
criticized by YouTubers, critics, and viewers alike, receiving millions of dislikes. Rewind did not return for 2020 due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, and YouTube announced the following year that the series would be discontinued leading to
other YouTubers to make their own YouTube Rewind videos.


Video games
Video game companies and products
The video game industry continued to be dominated by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft; Minecraft became the best-selling
game of all time in 2019.[560]
Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One were released in 2013,[561] and in the United States the PlayStation 4
became the highest-selling console of the decade, surpassing Nintendo, releasing games such as Marvel's Spider-Man,
God of War, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us, and Bloodborne.[562] The Nintendo Switch launched in 2017 and was
responsible for bringing Nintendo's success back, the success of the console initially spawned by the strong sales of both
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, as well as Wii U ports/sequels with Super Mario
Maker (Wii U) and Super Mario Maker 2 (Nintendo Switch), Splatoon (Wii U) and Splatoon 2 (Nintendo Switch), and
updated "Deluxe" versions of Mario Kart 8 and New Super Mario Bros. U, among many others. Micro-consoles also
emerged during the decade, a notable example being the Ouya, a system which was a commercial and critical failure that
received attention online.
Handheld gaming console revenue was overtaken by mobile gaming revenue in 2011, due to the rise of smartphones and
freemium apps.[563] The use of iPods, tablets, and cell phones became one of the most popular forms of gaming as the
decade progressed with the rise of mobile games, expanding the industry's appeal among less traditional markets such as
women and older adults. Gaming apps such as Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Plants vs. Zombies, Fruit Ninja, Candy Crush,
Flappy Bird, Clash of Clans, Temple Run, Smash Hit, Doodle Jump, Geometry Dash, Subway Surfers, and Pokémon Go
became huge hits.
The popularity of video games increased across the world, as the Nintendo Wii influenced gaming in the early part of the
decade,[564] and the Nintendo 3DS provided 3D gaming through autostereoscopy.[565] The successful Wii was followed
by the Wii U in 2012, a commercial failure.[564] Ports and sequels to Wii U games on the Nintendo Switch would sell
considerably better than their Wii U counterparts, and even though well-received games like Super Mario 3D World and
Nintendo Land released on Wii U, the console still ultimately failed due to poor marketing and public confusion.[566] The
Nintendo Wii would be responsible for the most critically acclaimed game of the 2010s decade, Super Mario Galaxy 2
(which is also often considered one of the greatest video games of all time by game critics).
The Wii (and later to a lesser extent the Wii U) would singlehandedly cause the increased use of motion controls in
gaming with its Wii line up of games such as Wii Play: Motion, Wii Fit U, Wii Sports Club, Wii Party and Wii Party U, all
released in the 2010s. Motion controls would carry over to Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con in 2017, and would form the
foundation of 2010's motion-based PlayStation Move and Xbox Kinect, counterparts and competitors to the Wii. In
addition to Super Mario Galaxy 2, it is notable in mentioning that Nintendo Wii released a large group of critically
acclaimed games in the early 2010s with popular titles such as Kirby's Epic Yarn, Donkey Kong Country Returns (both
games later in the decade released on 3DS), The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, and Sonic Colors; as well Portal 2 was
a critical success on Xbox and PlayStation early in the decade.[567][568]

The 2010s marked the growth, release, and large expansion of the "Toys To Life" category. Brands such as Nintendo's
Amiibo became massively popular, and allowed figurines to be bought which were scanned into games to level up, train
your figurine, or receive goods for your figurine. The Amiibo skyrocketed in success due to the roster of figurines
available for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, with many posting videos of them online going "amiibo
hunting" mostly around late 2014 and 2015. Skylanders and Disney Infinity also remained popular at the time, as fads.
The Nintendo Labo released in 2018, was also a part of the "Toys To Life" brand of video games, using cardboard to
create objects such as a fishing pole, a crank, and a race-car wheel to be played with games.
Online and multiplayer games
By the early 2010s, online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as Xbox and PlayStation. During the
2010s, as the number of Internet users increased, two new video game genres rapidly gained worldwide popularity – battle
royales and multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBA). Both designed exclusively for multiplayer gameplay over on the
Internet. First-person shooters genre were also popular genre before and during the decade. These genres are commonly
played in Esports.
Professional gaming, also known as Esports, although was well known in the 2000s, it became tremendously big incurring
a large increase in both viewership and prize money. By the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports
would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of
the global esports revenue in 2020. The increasing availability of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube
and Twitch, have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions.
Since the 2010s, a common trend among online games has been operating them as games as a service, using monetization
schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered games. Unlike purchased retail
games, online games have the problem of not being permanently playable, as they require special servers in order to
function.
Let's Plays
YouTube and Twitch became a platform for "Let's Players" to upload videos of themselves playing certain games, which
led to the popularity of existing games and newer indie games like Cuphead, Undertale, Terraria, Octodad/Octodad:
Dadliest Catch, Shovel Knight, Stardew Valley, and Five Nights at Freddy's (indie games like Cuphead were lauded for its
rubber hose animation style, while Undertale's soundtrack like "Megalovania" came to light and Five Nights At Freddy's
became well known for its lore).
"Let's Players" were even referenced in greater pop culture such as the 2014 episode Rehash on South Park, where
Pewdiepie would be featured onto the show. Jimmy Kimmel would make a sketch parody on his YouTube channel where
he would ridicule the "let's plays" culture which led to backlash from the gaming community.
Video games and movies
In the 2010s movies based on video game franchises became popular, grossing more and being talked about in the media
and among fans more than ever before. Movies like Detective Pikachu starring Ryan Reynolds (which starred additional
actors like Kathryn Newton as Lucy Stevens and Bill Nighy as Howard Clifford) broke box office records for movies
based on game series at the time, while movies like Jim Carrey's debut in Sonic The Hedgehog created buzz in the media
and on shows like Conan (where the film and its fans were satirized) in 2019 for the movie's depiction of a more realistic
looking hedgehog character, which by demand of the fans, was changed into a more cartoon version of the titular
character to much like and approval upon the November 2019 trailer and movie's release.
In early 2018 Nintendo and Illumination jointly announced (after the 2015 reveal of Nintendo's planned Universal theme
parks) that they were working on a Super Mario Bros. movie. The announcement by Nintendo and Illumination was met
with internet speculation; the new Illumination Super Mario film replaced the Sony-Nintendo Super Mario film that was
leaked during the 2014 Sony Pictures hack.
Video game themed movies became popular as well, with films such as Ready Player One, Pixels, Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World, Wreck-It Ralph, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Jumanji: The Next Level.

The best-selling games of every year throughout this decade were as follows:
2010: Call of Duty: Black Ops[569]
2011: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3[569]
2012: Call of Duty: Black Ops II[569]
2013: Grand Theft Auto V[569]
2014: Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare[569]
2015: Call of Duty: Black Ops III[569]
2016: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare[569]
2017: Call of Duty: WWII[569]
2018: Red Dead Redemption 2[569]
2019: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare[570]



Analysis
As the decade drew to a close, some commentators looked back on it as a politically unstable period. An article in the New
York Times stated: "With the rise of nationalist movements and a backlash against globalisation on both sides of the
Atlantic, the liberal post-World War II order – based on economic integration and international institutions – began to
unravel." It heavily discussed the US presidency of Donald Trump (a reality TV Star and businessman with no political
experience at the time of taking office, succeeding Barack Obama) whilst also commenting, "Echoes of Mr. Trump's
nationalist populism can be found in Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain's recent electoral victory and the Brexit
referendum of 2016, and in the ascent of the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Prime Minister Narendra
Modi of India. Democracy is under threat in Hungary and Poland. Once fringe right-wing parties with openly racist
agendas are rebranding themselves in Sweden and Belgium. And far-right groups in Germany and Spain are now the
third-largest parties in those nations' parliaments."[572] A December 2019 piece in The Guardian argued that the 2010s
would be remembered "as a time of crises", elaborating "there have been crises of democracy and the economy; of the
climate and poverty; of international relations and national identity; of privacy and technology". The article also noted
that, in Britain, "politics since 2010 has often been manic. Parties have hastily changed their leaders and policies;
sometimes their entire guiding philosophies. Last week's general election was the fourth of the decade; the 1980s, 1990s
and 2000s had two apiece."[573] Similar trends of political unrest were felt beyond the Western world, as suggested in The
Asian Review, which described the 2010s as a "tumultuous time for Asia, sometimes tragic, sometimes triumphant and
never dull".[574]
