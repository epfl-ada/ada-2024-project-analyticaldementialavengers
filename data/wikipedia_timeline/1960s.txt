The 1960s (pronounced "nineteen-sixties", shortened to the " '60s" or the "Sixties") was a decade that
began on January 1, 1960, and ended on December 31, 1969.[1]
While the achievements of humans being launched into space, orbiting Earth, perform spacewalk and
walking on the Moon extended exploration, the Sixties are known as the "countercultural decade" in the
United States and other Western countries. There was a revolution in social norms, including clothing,
music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, civil rights, precepts of military duty, and schooling. Some
people denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, the decay of social order, and

the fall or relaxation of social taboos. A wide range of music emerged; from popular music inspired by
and including the Beatles (in the United States known as the British Invasion), the folk music revival, to
the poetic lyrics of Bob Dylan. In the United States the Sixties were also called the "cultural decade"
while in the United Kingdom (especially London) it was called the Swinging Sixties.
The United States had four presidents that served during the decade; Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. Eisenhower was near the end of his term and left office
in January 1961, and Kennedy was assassinated[2][3] in 1963. Kennedy had wanted Keynesian[4] and
staunch anti-communist social reforms. These were passed under Johnson including civil rights for
African Americans and health care for the elderly and the poor. Despite his large-scale Great Society
programs, Johnson was increasingly disliked by the New Left at home and abroad. For some, May 1968
meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by
the so-called new social movements.[5]
After the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro, the United States attempted to depose the new leader by
training Cuban exiles and invading the island of Cuba. This led to Cuba to ally itself to the Soviet Union,
a hostile enemy to the United States, resulting in an international crisis when Cuba hosted Soviet ballistic
missiles similar to Turkey hosting American missiles, which brought the possibility of causing World War
III. However, after negotiations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R, both agreed to withdraw their weapons
averting potential nuclear warfare.
After U.S. president Kennedy's assassination, direct tensions between the superpower countries of the
United States and the Soviet Union developed into a contest with proxy wars, insurgency funding, puppet
governments and other overall influence mainly in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This "Cold War"
dominated the world's geopolitics during the decade. Construction of the Berlin Wall by East Germany
began in 1961. Africa was in a period of radical political change as 32 countries gained independence
from their European colonial rulers. The heavy-handed American role in the Vietnam War lead to an antiVietnam War movement with outraged student protestors around the globe culminating in the protests of
1968.
China saw the end of Mao's Great Leap Forward in 1962 that led to many Chinese to die from the
deadliest famine in human history and the start of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Its stated
goal was to preserve Chinese communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from
Chinese society, leading to the arrests of a many Chinese politicians, the killings of millions of civilians
and ethnic minorities, and the destruction of many historical and cultural buildings, artifacts and materials
all of which would last until the death of Mao Zedong.
By the end of the 1950s, post-war reconstructed Europe began an economic boom. World War II had
closed up social classes with remnants of the old feudal gentry disappearing. A developing upperworking-class (a newly redefined middle-class) in Western Europe could afford a radio, television,
refrigerator and motor vehicles. The Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving
quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the
decade; overall, the worldwide economy prospered in the 1960s with expansion of the middle class and
the increase of new domestic technology.
In the United Kingdom, the Labour Party gained power in 1964 with Harold Wilson as prime minister
through most of the decade.[6] In France, the protests of 1968 led to President Charles de Gaulle
temporarily fleeing the country.[7] Italy formed its first left-of-center government in March 1962 with

Aldo Moro becoming prime minister in 1963. Soviet leaders during the decade were Nikita Khrushchev
until 1964 and Leonid Brezhnev.
During the 1960s, the world population increased from 3.0 to 3.7 billion people. There were
approximately 1.15 billion births and 500 million deaths.

The Vietnam War (1955–1975)
1961 – Substantial (approximately 700)
American advisory forces first arrive in
Vietnam.
1962 – By mid-1962, the number of U.S.
military advisers in South Vietnam had risen
from 900 to 12,000.

1964 – In direct response to the minor naval
engagement known as the Gulf of Tonkin
incident which occurred on 2 August 1964,
the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, a joint
resolution of the U.S. Congress, was passed
on 10 August 1964. The resolution gave U.S.
president Lyndon B. Johnson authorization,
without a formal declaration of war by
Congress, for the use of military force in
Southeast Asia. The Johnson administration
subsequently cited the resolution as legal
authority for its rapid escalation of U.S.
military involvement in the Vietnam War.[9]

Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974) – the war was fought between Portugal's military
and the emerging nationalist movements in Portugal's African colonies. It was a decisive
ideological struggle and armed conflict of the Cold War in African (Portuguese Africa and
surrounding nations) and European (mainland Portugal) scenarios. Unlike other

European nations, the Portuguese regime did not leave its African colonies, or the
overseas provinces, during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, various armed
independence movements, most prominently led by communist-led parties who
cooperated under the CONCP umbrella and pro-U.S. groups, became active in these
areas, most notably in Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea. During the war,
several atrocities were committed by all forces involved in the conflict.

Algeria also contributed troops and arms.[10] At the war's end, Israel had gained control
of the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan
Heights. The results of the war affect the geopolitics of the region to this day.
The Algerian War came to a close in 1962.
The Nigeria Civil War began in 1967.

election of Joaquín Balaguer as president.
The Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 occurred as part of the Transition to the New
Order that marked the beginning of Suharto's 31-year presidency.
Cultural Revolution in China (1966–1976) – a period of widespread social and political
upheaval in the People's Republic of China which was launched by Mao Zedong, the
chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Mao alleged that "liberal bourgeois" elements
were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore capitalism.
Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary class struggle by
mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed Red Guards groups
around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers,
and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural
Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969
and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the
Revolution.
The Naxalite movement in India began in 1967 with an armed uprising of tribals against
local landlords in the village of Naxalbari, West Bengal, led by certain leaders of the

Communist Party of India (Marxist). The movement was influenced by Mao Zedong's
ideology and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among
the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and
paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.
The Troubles in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the Northern Ireland civil rights
movement in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.

prison and put the country on the road to liberation in the early 1970s.
The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 in the Tenderloin district of San
Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded transgender riots in United States
history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.
The Stonewall riots occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a
series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the
Stonewall Inn, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently
cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community
fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and
they have become the defining event that marked the start of the gay rights movement in
the United States and around the world.
In 1967, the National Farmers Organization withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an
effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.
The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France.
Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France
and Italy), with which the student-based new left was involved. The most spectacular
manifestation of this was the May student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a
general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed
capable of overthrowing the government of Charles de Gaulle. De Gaulle went off to visit
French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade
union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.
University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in
London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.
In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland
and Yugoslavia they protested against restrictions on free speech by communist regimes.
The Tlatelolco massacre – was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters
and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the
Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City.

confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the
presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. After an American Naval
(quarantine) blockade of Cuba the Soviet Union under the
leadership of Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove their missiles
from Cuba in exchange for the U.S. removing its missiles from
Turkey.
On 13 February 1960, France detonated its first atomic bomb.

Decolonization and independence
The transformation of Africa from colonialism to independence in what is known as the
decolonisation of Africa dramatically accelerated during the decade, with 32 countries
gaining independence between 1960 and 1968, marking the end of the European empires
that once dominated the African continent. However, many of these new post-colonial states
would struggle with internal and external issues including famine, corruption, genocide,
disease, and violent conflicts in the 1960s and succeeding decades.[13] Many of these
issues were caused or exacerbated by American and Soviet involvement during the Cold
War with each side supporting various strongmen, dictators, and guerillas favorable to their
causes in these countries.[14][15] Economic development on the continent has been difficult,
but many nations who decolonized in the 1960s began to see a rebound and unprecedented
growth in the first quarter of the 21st century. As a whole, Africa's GDP rose by an average
of over 6% a year between 2013 and 2022, a rate only outpaced by China.[16][17]

The Jean Lesage Liberal government created a welfare state (État-Providence) and
fomented the rise of active nationalism among Francophone French-speaking Quebecer
Québécois.
On 15 February 1965, the new flag of Canada was adopted in Canada after a muchanticipated debate known as the Great Canadian flag debate.
In 1960, the Canadian Bill of Rights becomes law and suffrage (as well as the right for any

Mexico
The student and New Left protests in 1968 coincided with political upheavals in a number of
other countries. Although these events often sprung from completely different causes, they
were influenced by reports and images of what was happening in the United States and
France.[18]
Europe
British prime minister Harold Macmillan delivered his "Wind of Change" speech in 1960.

The government of the East Germany authorized construction of
the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 to prevent East Germans from
leaving East Berlin to West Berlin.[19]

from office due to his increasingly erratic and authoritarian
behavior. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin then became the
new leaders of the Soviet Union.[21]
In Czechoslovakia, 1968 was the year of Alexander Dubček's
Prague Spring, a source of inspiration to many Western leftists
who admired Dubček's "socialism with a human face". The Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia in August ended these hopes and also
fatally damaged the chances of the orthodox communist parties
drawing many recruits from the student protest movement.[22]

Asia
China
The Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) and the SinoSoviet split (1961–1989)
1966 marked the beginning of the Cultural
Revolution that was launched by Mao Zedong
and lasted until his death in 1976. The goal of
the revolution was to preserve Chinese
East German construction workers
communism by purging Chinese society of its
building the Berlin Wall, 20 November
traditional and remaining capitalist elements.
1961
Though it failed to achieve its main objectives,
the revolution marked the effective return of Mao
to the center of power.
Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's removal from power in 1964, Sino-Soviet
relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet
suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968 as the latter now claimed the right to intervene
in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. In March 1969,
armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in the former Manchuria and this
finally drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S. as Mao Zedong decided that
the Soviet Union posed the bigger threat to China.
India
A literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna and other cities by a group of
writers and painters who called themselves "Hungryalists", or members of the Hungry
generation. The band of writers wanted to change virtually everything and were arrested

with several cases filed against them on various charges; they ultimately won these
cases.[23]
Indonesia
President Sukarno banned the Masyumi Party on 15 August 1960 and caused a tension the
between government and Islamist groups.[24]
The Transition to the New Order (1965–1968)
In the early hours of 1 October 1965, a group of army officers launched a coup d'état
attempt in Jakarta, assassinated six senior Indonesian Army generals and a junior army
officer. They also seized Merdeka Square and proclaimed the establishment of "the
Revolutionary Council" through a radio broadcast later in the morning, with Lieutenant
Colonel Untung Syamsuri as its leader.
On the same day, Major General Suharto successfully persuaded the soldiers on
Merdeka Square to join forces with the Indonesian Army Strategic Reserve Command
divisions and launched a counterattack on the movement, ending the coup attempt.
Three days later, the bodies of seven army officers were found buried in an old well in
Lubang Buaya and the bodies were recovered.
In the aftermath of the coup d'état attempt, the people blamed the attempt on the
Communist Party of Indonesia, prompting a mass purge against leftists and communist
sympathizers across the country. Around 500,000-1,000,000 casualties were
massacred. The killings were mostly done by the locals with the help of the Army.
Soon, mass demonstrations and protests from the Indonesian Students' Action Front
against President Sukarno's government occurred. President Sukarno was notorious for
his friendly approach towards the leftists, particularly the Communist Party of Indonesia.
In the climax of the protests, President Sukarno signed the Supersemar on 11 March
1966, effectively transferring authority to Major General Suharto to restore order and
ensure security in the country. On 12 March 1967, President Sukarno was stripped of his
political power by the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS) and Major
General Suharto became acting president. Later, he became president formally on 27
March 1968. Sukarno lived under house arrest until his death in June 1970.
Japan and South Korea
The Japanese economic miracle (1960s–1990s)
Japan's remarkable economic growth between the post-World War II era and the end of
the Cold War. During the economic boom, Japan rapidly became the world's secondlargest economy at the time (after the United States).
In 1960, Japan was wracked by the massive Anpo protests against the revision of the
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister Nobusuke
Kishi; Kishi's successor, Hayato Ikeda, began implementing economic policies, known
as the Income Doubling Plan removed most of Japan's anti-monopoly laws and
promised to double the size of Japan's economy within 10 years. Eisaku Satō became
Prime Minister of Japan four years later, succeeding Ikeda due to health issues.
The 1964 Summer Olympics were held in Japan, the first time the country hosted them
and the first time that the Olympic Games were held in Asia. The world's first bullet train
(the Tōkaidō Shinkansen between Tokyo Station and Shin-Ōsaka Station) commences
operations; it is the oldest high-speed rail system in the world.
The Second and Third Republics of Korea (1960–1972)

The April Revolution were mass protests in South Korea against President Syngman
Rhee and the First Republic from 11 to 26 April 1960, which led to Rhee's resignation.
The Second Republic was established as a parliamentary government under President
Yun Bo-seon and Prime Minister Chang Myon. The Second Republic ended the First
Republic, formed a liberal democracy, and formulated the first Five-Year Plans to
develop the formerly-neglected economy.
The May 16 coup and the establishment of the SCNR, led by Major General Park Chung
Hee on 16 May 1961, put an effective end to the Second Republic. Park was one of a
group of military leaders who had been pushing for the de-politicization of the military.
The Miracle on the Han River began with the Five-Year Plans of South Korea, a series of
economic development projects implemented by President Park Chung Hee. South
Korea received US$800 million from Japan under property claims and was mostly
dependent on foreign aid (largely from the U.S. in exchange for South Korea's
involvement in the Vietnam War).
South Korea's first diplomatic relations with Japan were established under the Third
Republic and South Korea-Japan relations were normalized in the Treaty on Basic
Relations signed on 22 July 1965 and in an agreement ratified on 14 August 1965.
Japan agreed to provide a large amount of compensation, grants, and loans to South
Korea and the two countries began economic and political cooperation.
Africa
On 1 September 1969, the Libyan monarchy was overthrown and
a radical, revolutionary government headed by dictator Muammar
Gaddafi took power.
On 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from Great
Britain.
South America
In 1964, a successful coup against the democratically elected
government of Brazilian president João Goulart initiated a military
dictatorship that caused over 20 years of oppression.
Gamal Abdel Nasser,
The Argentine revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara travelled to
African leader
Africa and then Bolivia in his campaign to spread worldwide
revolution. He was captured and executed in 1967 by the Bolivian
army and afterwards became an iconic figure for leftists around
the world.
Juan Velasco Alvarado took power by means of a coup in Peru in 1968.

Economics
The United States
During the 1960s the United States was in the postwar economic boom. The 1960s are remembered as a
time period of rapid workforce growth (roughly 33% between February 1961 and December 1969),[25]
tax cuts, low unemployment,[26][27] rapid GDP growth, gains in productivity and generally low inflation.
After the Recession of 1960–1961 the United States experienced sustained rapid economic growth which

began in February 1961 and ended with the Recession of 1969–1970. It lasted a total of 106 months,
which made it the longest recorded economic expansion in the history of the United States until the 1990s
United States boom.
On January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy became the president of the United States. In his campaign, John
F. Kennedy promised to "get America moving again." His goal was economic growth of 4–6% per year
and unemployment below 4%.To do this, he proposed a wide range of policies which embraced
Keynesian economics (which he is the first president to do so). Among these policies included a 7% tax
credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment, Income tax cuts and an increase in the
federal minimum wage.
Although, the 1960s were not perfect. The government routinely produced fiscal deficits (as a result of
the tax cuts and increased expenditure embarked under Kennedy), with only one surplus during this time
period (as opposed to the 1950s which produced 3).[28] Furthermore, by 1966 inflation began to climb,
which is a general trend that continued into the 1970's. By the end of the decade under Nixon, the
combined inflation and unemployment rate known as the misery index (economics) had exploded to
nearly 10% with inflation at 6.2% and unemployment at 3.5% and by 1975 the misery index was almost
20%.[29] By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by
1969.[30]

Disasters
Natural:
The 1960 Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean earthquake, is to date the
most powerful earthquake ever recorded, rating 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale. It
caused localized tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25
meters (82 ft). The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo,
Hawaii.
1963 Skopje earthquake was a 6.1 moment magnitude earthquake which occurred in
Skopje, SR Macedonia (present-day Republic of Macedonia) on 26 July 1963, which killed
over 1,070 people, injured between 3,000 and 4,000 and left more than 200,000 people
homeless. About 80% of the city was destroyed.
1963 – Vajont dam disaster – The Vajont dam flood in Italy was caused by a mountain
sliding in the dam and causing a flood wave that killed approximately 2,000 people in the

towns in its path.
1964 – The Good Friday earthquake, the most powerful earthquake recorded in the U.S.
and North America, struck Alaska and killed 143 people.
1965 – Hurricane Betsy caused severe damage to the U.S. Gulf Coast, especially in the
state of Louisiana.
1969 – The Cuyahoga River caught fire in Ohio. Fires had erupted on the river many times,
including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which
described the Cuyahoga as the river that "oozes rather than flows" and in which a person
"does not drown but decays." This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control
resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of
the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
1969 – Hurricane Camille hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. It peaked and made
landfall with 175 mph (280 km/h) winds and caused $1.42 billion (1969 USD) in damages.
Non-natural:
On 16 December 1960, a United Airlines DC-8 and a Trans World Airlines Lockheed
Constellation collided over New York City and crashed, killing 134 people.
On 15 February 1961, Sabena Flight 548 crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all
72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground. Among those killed were all 18
members of the US figure skating team, on their way to the World Championships.
On 16 March 1962, Flying Tiger Line Flight 739, a Lockheed Super Constellation,
inexplicably disappeared over the Western Pacific, leaving all 107 on board presumed dead.
Since the wreckage of the aircraft is lost to this day, the cause of the crash remains a
mystery.
On 3 June 1962, Air France Flight 007, a Boeing 707, crashed on takeoff from Paris. 130
people were killed in the crash while 2 survived.
On 20 May 1965, PIA Flight 705 crashed on approach to Cairo, Egypt. 121 died while 6
survived.
On 4 February 1966, All Nippon Airways Flight 60, a Boeing 727, plunged into Tokyo Bay for
reasons unknown. All 133 people on board died.
On 5 March 1966, BOAC Flight 911 broke up in mid-air and crashed on the slopes of Mount
Fuji. All 124 aboard died.
On 8 December 1966, the car ferry SS Heraklion sank in the Aegean Sea during a storm,
killing 217 people.
On 16 March 1969, a DC-9 operating Viasa Flight 742 crashed in the Venezuelan city of
Maracaibo. A total of 155 people died in the crash.

Social and political movements
Counterculture and social revolution
In the second half of the decade, young people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the old
time, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level of
materialism which was so common during the era. This created a "counterculture" that sparked a social
revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the
conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military
intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became
known as hippies. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the sexual
revolution, questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women

and minorities. The Underground Press, a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a
unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially
accepted drug use (including LSD and marijuana) and psychedelic music.

Anti-war movement

Mobilization Committee to End the
War in Vietnam's 21 October 1967
March on the Pentagon

The war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of
over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500
American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in
the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans
protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war
dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest
escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and
university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the
movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about
the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A
mass movement began rising in opposition to the Vietnam War,
including the National Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam's
1967 march to the United Nations and its March on the Pentagon,
the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests at which the
slogan "The whole world is watching" became famous, and
continuing in the massive Moratorium protests in 1969 as well as
the movement of resistance to conscription ("the Draft") for the
war.

The antiwar movement was initially based on the older 1950s Peace movement, heavily influenced by the
American Communist Party, but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass
movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a "sit-in". Other terms
heard in the United States included "the Draft", "draft dodger", "conscientious objector", and "Vietnam
vet". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: "If you're old enough to die for your country, you're
old enough to vote."

Civil rights movement
Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s,
African Americans in the United States organized a movement
to end legalized racial discrimination and obtain voting rights.
This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955
and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the
Black Power movement, which lasted roughly from 1966 to
1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include
racial dignity, economic and political self-sufficiency, and antiimperialism.
The movement was characterized by major campaigns of civil
resistance. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of civil disobedience
and nonviolent protest produced crisis situations between

Leaders of the civil rights movement's

in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln

activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities
often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African
Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful
Montgomery bus boycott (1955–1956) in Alabama, sit-ins such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins
(1960) in North Carolina, marches such as the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama, and
other nonviolent activities.
Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of Civil
Rights Act of 1964[43] that banned discrimination based on "race, color, religion, or national origin" in
employment practices and public accommodations, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that restored and
protected voting rights, the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 that dramatically opened
entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968
that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

Hispanic and Chicano movement
Another large ethnic minority group, the Mexican-Americans, are among other Hispanics in the U.S. who
fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American
populations were in the Southwestern United States, such as California with over 1 million Chicanos in
Los Angeles alone, and Texas where Jim Crow laws included Mexican-Americans as "non-white" in
some instances to be legally segregated.
Socially, the Chicano Movement addressed what it perceived to be negative ethnic stereotypes of
Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of
literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end
social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official bilingualism in federal
and state governments.
The Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the
twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination.
One of those organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens, was formed in 1929 and
remains active today.[44]
The movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I. Forum,
which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights
organizations.[45]
Mexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 Mendez
v. Westminster U.S. Supreme Court ruling which declared that segregating children of "Mexican and
Latin descent" was unconstitutional and the 1954 Hernandez v. Texas ruling which declared that Mexican
Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the 14th
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.[46][47]
The most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.[48] Although modeled
after the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF has also taken on many of the
functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.

Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and
socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states. The main
concentration of the population was in New York City.
In the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music,
foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanishlanguage television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country,
especially in U.S.–Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the
Cuban American community in Miami, Florida.
The multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s
was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of
reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now
becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture. A document known as the Port Huron
Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, "while these and other
problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective
concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The
declaration "all men are created equal..." rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the
big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic
and military investments in the Cold War status quo." These intolerable issues became too visible to
ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the
responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.

Second-wave feminism
A second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early
1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning de
jure inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and de facto
inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the
home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a Presidential Commission
on the Status of Women found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of
life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the Equal
Pay Act of 1963, Title IX, etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal
freedom and professional success.
Feminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and
political views that limited women. In 1963, with Betty Friedan's book, The Feminine Mystique, the role
of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was
beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with
other feminists, founded the National Organization for Women. In 1968, "Women's Liberation" became a
household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the civil rights movement
when New York Radical Women, led by Robin Morgan, protested the annual Miss America pageant in
Atlantic City, New Jersey. The movement continued throughout the next decades. Gloria Steinem was a
key feminist.

Gay rights movement

The United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers
had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement. These groups were rather conservative in their practices,
emphasizing that gay men and women are no different from those who are straight and deserve full
equality. This philosophy would be dominant again after AIDS, but by the very end of the 1960s, the
movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and
encouraging gay pride.
The symbolic birth of the gay rights movement would not come until the decade had almost come to a
close. Gays were not allowed by law to congregate. Gay establishments such as the Stonewall Inn in New
York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people. On a night in late June 1969, LGBT
people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets. This uprising called the
Stonewall riots began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause
dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.

New Left
The rapid rise of a "New Left" applied the class perspective of Marxism to postwar America but had little
organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the Communist Party, and even went
as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the
ideology of C. Wright Mills, the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and
its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) became the
organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in
Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based Trotskyist, Maoist and anarchist
groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to militancy.

Crime
The 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960
and 1969 reported incidence of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and
have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.[49] Large riots broke out in many cities like Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, Oakland, California and Washington, D.C. By
the end of the decade, politicians like George Wallace and Richard Nixon campaigned on restoring law
and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.

Science and technology
Science
Space exploration
The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent
the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into outer space during the Vostok 1 mission on 12 April 1961, and scored a
host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961,

President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of
landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.
In June 1963, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman
in space during the Vostok 6 mission. In 1965, Soviets
launched the first probe to hit another planet of the Solar
System (Venus), Venera 3, and the first probe to make a soft
landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, Luna
9. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched Luna 10, which
became the first space probe to enter orbit around the Moon,
and in September 1968, Zond 5 flew the first terrestrial
beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.
The deaths of astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger
B. Chaffee in the Apollo 1 fire on 27 January 1967, put a
temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward
progress was steady, with the Apollo 8 crew (Frank Borman,
Jim Lovell, William Anders) being the first crewed mission to
orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of
1968.
On 20 July 1969, the first humans landed on the Moon. The
Apollo 11 mission, launched on 16 July 1969, carried mission
Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot
Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and
Aldrin and Armstrong flew the Lunar Module Eagle to the
lunar surface. Apollo 11 fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's
goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he
had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of
Congress on 25 May 1961: "I believe that this nation should
commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out,
of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the
Earth."

On 21 December 1968, the Apollo 8 crew
took a picture, for the first time in history,
of the entire Earth

The Apollo 11 mission landed the first
humans on the Moon in July 1969.

The Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer Sergey Korolyov in 1966.
Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an
inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon. Shortly after the American
Apollo 1 disaster, tragedy struck the Soviet program when cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed
when the parachutes on his Soyuz 1 flight failed.
A succession of uncrewed American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, Venus, and Mars during the
1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.
Other scientific developments
1960 – The female birth-control contraceptive, the pill, was released in the United States
after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.
1963 – The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA

1964 – The discovery and confirmation of the Cosmic
microwave background in 1964 secured the Big Bang as
the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.
1965 – AstroTurf introduced.
1967 – First heart transplantation operation by Professor
Christiaan Barnard in South Africa.
1967 – Discovery of the first known pulsar (a rapidly
spinning neutron star).
During the late 1960s, the Green Revolution achieved a
major leap in agricultural production, mitigating a potential
famine situation.[50]

The birth control pill was
introduced in 1960.

Technology
Shinkansen, the world's first high-speed rail service began in
1964.
Automobiles and Motorcycles
As the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of
1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy
for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in
A 0 series Shinkansen high-speed
rail set in Tokyo, May 1967
the late 1960s, with muscle cars sold by most makes. The compact
Ford Mustang, launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest
successes. The "Big Three" American automakers enjoyed their
highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of Studebaker in 1966 left American
Motors Corporation as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into
different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included compact and mid-sized cars in
addition to full-sized ones.
The popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965
with the introduction of the Renault 16, many of this car's design principles live on in its modern
counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space.
The Mini, released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but
technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.
Japanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as
the Toyota Corolla, Datsun 510, and the first popular Japanese sports car, the Datsun 240Z, were released
in the mid- to late-1960s.
Mopeds and Scooters gains popularity in these decade, with Honda Super Cub in United States, Japan
and Europe, Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon in Japan and Vespa, Kreidler Florett,Zundapp and Sachs mopeds in
Western Europe.
