2000s
The 2000s (pronounced "two-thousands"; shortened to the '00s and known as the aughts or
noughties) was a decade that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.
The early part of the decade saw the long-predicted breakthrough of economic giants in Asia, like
India and China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. It is also benefited
from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly
dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries
sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in
energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the
decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing
and credit in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other
financial institutions. The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning
in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.
The decade saw the rise of the Internet, which grew from covering 6.7% to 25.7% of the world
population. This contributed to globalization during the decade, which allowed faster communication
among people around the world;[1][2][3][4][5] social networking sites arose as a new way for people to
stay in touch from distant locations, as long as they had internet access. Myspace was the most popular
social networking website until June 2009, when Facebook overtook it in number of American users.
Email continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace "snail mail" as the primary
way of sending letters and other messages to people in distant locations. Google, YouTube, Ask.com
and Wikipedia emerged to become among the top 10 most popular websites. Amazon overtook eBay
as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL significantly declined in popularity throughout the
decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite and
Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN fell from the second to sixth most popular site, though it
quadrupled its monthly visits. Yahoo! maintained relatively stable popularity, remaining the most
popular website for most of the decade.

The war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The
International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003, a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq,
and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in
Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade.
The Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars
that ended included the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the
Sri Lankan Civil War. Wars that began included the conflict in the Niger Delta, the Houthi insurgency, and the Mexican drug war.
Climate change and global warming became common concerns in the 2000s. Prediction tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored
organizations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern Review influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of
countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in
this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the NASA and the NOAA. Major natural disasters included Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and earthquakes in
Pakistan and China in 2005 and 2008, respectively. The deadliest natural disaster[a] and most powerful earthquake of the 21st century occurred in 2004 when a
9.1–9.3 Mw earthquake and its subsequent tsunami struck multiple nations in the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people.[6]
Usage of computer-generated imagery became more widespread in films produced during the 2000s, especially with the success of 2001's Shrek and 2003's
Finding Nemo, the latter becoming the best-selling DVD of all time. Anime films gained more exposure outside Japan with the release of Spirited Away. 2009's
Avatar became the highest-grossing film. Documentary and mockumentary films, such as March of the Penguins, Super Size Me, Borat and Surf's Up, were
popular in the 2000s. 2004's Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore was the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and
conversion to digital cinema started. Video game consoles released in this decade included the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox
360; while portable video game consoles included the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Wii Sports was the decade's best-selling
console video game, while New Super Mario Bros. was the decade's best-selling portable video game. J. K. Rowling was the best-selling author in the decade
overall thanks to the Harry Potter book series, although she did not pen the best-selling individual book, being second to The Da Vinci Code.[7] Eminem was
named the music artist of the decade by Billboard.
During this decade, the world population grew from 6.1 to 6.9 billion people. Approximately 1.35 billion people were born, and 550 million people died.[8]

Name for the decade
Orthographically, the decade can be written as the "2000s" or the " '00s". In the English-speaking world, a name for the decade wasn't immediately accepted as
it had been for other decades such as the 1980s and 1990s ('80s, '90s).[9][10][11][12][13]
The aughts (American English)[14][15][16] or noughties (British English)[17][18] arise from the words aught and nought respectively, both meaning zero. The
noughties became a common name for the decade in the United Kingdom[19][20][21][22][23] and in New Zealand and Australia.[24][25]
Although use of the word aught to refer to zero is not widespread in the United States, the use of aughts to identify the decade became common there.[26][27][28]

Other spoken-word possibilities included "two-thousands", "twenty hundreds", "ohs", "oh ohs", "double ohs", "zeros", and "double zeros".[29][30][31] The years
of the decade can be referred to as '01, '02, etc., pronounced oh-one, oh-two, etc.


Politics and wars
The war on terror and War in Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks in 2001.[37][38] The International Criminal Court was formed in 2002. In 2003 a
United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and
affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts included the 2004 Madrid train bombings, 7/7 London bombings in
2005, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks related to al-Qaeda. The European Union expanded its sanctions amid Iran's failure to comply with its transparency
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and United Nations resolutions.
The war on terror generated extreme controversy around the world, with questions regarding the justification for certain U.S. actions leading to a loss of
support for the American government, both in and outside the United States.[39] The additional armed conflict occurred in the Middle East, including between
Israel and Hezbollah, then with Israel and Hamas. The most significant loss of life due to natural disasters came from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which
caused a tsunami that killed around one quarter-million people and displaced well over a million others.

Terrorist attacks
The most prominent terrorist attacks committed against the civilian population during the decade include:
September 11 attacks in New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania (2,977 killed)
2001 anthrax attacks in the United States (5 killed, 17 infected)
2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis in Moscow, Russia (171 killed)
2002 Bali bombings in Bali, Indonesia (202 killed)
2003 Casablanca bombings in Casablanca, Morocco (45 killed)
2003 Istanbul bombings in Istanbul, Turkey (57 killed)
2004 Madrid train bombings (192 killed)
2004 Beslan school hostage crisis (334 killed)
2005 London bombings (56 killed)
2007 Yazidi communities bombings (796 killed)
2008 Mumbai attacks (175 killed)
2009 Boko Haram uprising (1000+ killed)

Wars
The most prominent armed conflicts of the decade include:
International wars
War on terror (2001–present) – refers to several ideological, military, and diplomatic campaigns aimed at putting an end to international
terrorism by preventing groups defined by the U.S. and its allies as terrorist (mostly Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and
Hamas) from posing a threat to the U.S. and its allies, and by putting an end to state sponsorship of terrorism. The campaigns were launched
by the United States, with support from NATO and other allies, following the September 11 attacks that were carried out by al-Qaeda. Today
the term has become mostly associated with Bush administration-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) – In 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Canada, and Australia invaded
Afghanistan seeking to oust the Taliban and find al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden. In 2011, the US government claimed Navy
Seals had killed Bin Laden and buried his body at sea. Fatalities of coalition troops: 1,553 (2001 to 2009).[40]

Iraq War (2003–2011) – In 2003, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, and Poland
invaded and occupied Iraq. Claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction at its disposal were
later found to be unproven.[41] The war, which ended the rule of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, also
led to violence against the coalition forces and between many Sunni and Shia Iraqi groups and alQaeda operations in Iraq. Casualties of the Iraq War: Approximately 110,600 between March 2003 to
April 2009. Hussein was eventually sentenced to death and hanged on December 30, 2006.
Arab–Israeli conflict (1948 – present)
2006 Lebanon War (summer 2006) – took place in southern Lebanon and northern Israel. The
principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli military. The war that began as a
military operation in response to the abduction of two Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah
gradually strengthened and became a wider confrontation.
Israeli–Palestinian conflict (Early 20th century – present)
Second Intifada (2000–2005) – After the signing of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a
Palestinian state, in September 2000, the Second Intifada (uprising) broke out, a period of
intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. As a
result of the significant increase of suicide bombing attacks within Israeli population centers during
the first years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada,[42] in June 2002 Israel began the construction of the West
Bank Fence along the Green Line border arguing that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli
civilians from Palestinian terrorism. The significantly reduced number of incidents of suicide
bombings from 2002 to 2005 has been partly attributed to the barrier.[43] The barrier's construction,
which has been highly controversial, became a significant issue of contention between the two
sides. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among
combatants and among civilians – The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated
to be 5,500 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreign citizens.[44] Many
Palestinians consider the Second Intifada to be a legitimate war of national liberation against
foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[45]
Gaza War (2008–2009) – the frequent Hamas Qassam rocket and mortar fire launched from within
civilian population centers in Gaza towards the Israeli southern civilian communities led to an
Israeli military operation in Gaza, which had the stated aim of reducing the Hamas rocket attacks
and stopping the arms smuggling into the Gaza Strip. Throughout the conflict, Hamas further
intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, hitting civilian targets and reaching major
Israeli cities Beersheba and Ashdod, for the first time. The intense urban warfare in densely
populated Gaza combined with the use of massive firepower by the Israeli side[46] and the
intensified Hamas rocket attacks towards populated Israeli civilian targets led to a high toll on the
Palestinian side and among civilians.[47]

The war on terror

The Iraq War

The Second Congo War (1998–2003) – took place mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
widest interstate war in modern African history, it directly involved nine African nations, as well as about
twenty armed groups. It earned the epithet of "Africa's World War" and the "Great War of Africa." An
estimated 3.8 million people died, mostly from starvation and disease brought about by the deadliest
conflict since World War II. Millions more were displaced from their homes or sought asylum in
neighboring countries.
The Gaza War (2008–2009)
Russo-Georgian War (2008) – Russia invaded Georgia in response to Georgian aggression towards
civilians and attack on South Ossetia. Both Russia and Georgia were condemned internationally for their
actions.
The Second Chechen War (1999–2000) – the war was launched by the Russia on August 26, 1999, in response to the war in Dagestan and
the 1999 Russian apartment bombings, which were blamed on the Chechens. During the war, Russian forces largely recaptured the
separatist region of Chechnya.[48] The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the First Chechen War, in which the region gained de facto
independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.
The Eritrean–Ethiopian War came to a close in 2000.
Kivu conflict (2004–2009) – armed conflict between the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the Hutu Power group
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).
2009 Boko Haram uprising – an armed conflict between Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, and Nigerian security forces.
Civil wars and guerrilla wars
War in Darfur (2003–2020) – an armed conflict in the Darfur region of western Sudan. The conflict began
when the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Darfur
took up arms, accusing the government of oppressing black Africans in favor of Arabs. One side was
composed mainly of the Sudanese military and the Sudanese militia group Janjaweed, recruited mostly
from the Afro-Arab Abbala tribes of the northern Rizeigat region in Sudan. The other side was made up of
rebel groups, notably the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement,
recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. Millions of people
were displaced from their homes during the conflict.[49] There are various estimates on the number of
human casualties – Sudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 19,500 civilians[50] while certain
Irregular combatants in North
non-governmental organizations, such as the Coalition for International Justice, claim that over 400,000

in Darfur a genocide during his presidency.[52][53][54] The United States Congress unanimously passed
House Concurrent Resolution 467, which declared the situation in Darfur a state-sponsored genocide by
the Janjaweed.[55] In 2008, the International Criminal Court charged Omar al-Bashir with genocide for his
role in the War in Darfur.[56][57][58][59]
Mexican drug war (2006–present) – an armed conflict fought between rival drug cartels and the Mexican Armed Forces. Although Mexican
drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for quite some time, they have become more powerful since the demise of
Colombia's Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United
States.[60] Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for
control of the trafficking routes into the United States.[61][62][63] Roughly more than 16,851 people in total were killed between December
2006 until November 2009.[64]

In India, Naxalite–Maoist insurgency (1967–present) has grown alarmingly with attacks such as April 2010
Maoist attack in Dantewada, Jnaneswari Express train derailment, and Rafiganj train disaster. Naxalites
are a group of far-left radical communists, supportive of Maoist political sentiment and ideology. It is
presently the longest continuously active conflict worldwide. In 2006 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
called the Naxalites "The single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country."[65] In 2009,
he said the country was "losing the battle against Maoist rebels".[66] According to standard definitions the
Naxalite–Maoist insurgency is an ongoing conflict[67] between Maoist groups, known as Naxalites or
Naxals, and the Indian government.[65] On April 6, 2010, Maoist rebels killed 75 security forces in a jungle
ambush in central India in the worst-ever massacre of security forces by the insurgents. On the same day,
Gopal, a top Maoist leader, said the attack was a "direct consequence" of the government's Operation
Darfur refugee camp in Chad
Green Hunt offensive. This raised some voices of use of Indian Air Force against Naxalites, which were,
[68]
however, declined, citing "We can't use oppressive force against our own people".
The Colombian conflict continues causing deaths and terror in Colombia. Beginning in 1964, the FARC
and ELN narcoterrorist groups were taking control of rural areas of the country by the beginning of the
decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the
State would lose the war against guerrillas. However, after the failure of the peace process and the
activation of Plan Colombia, Álvaro Uribe was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on
terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The AUC
paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The Popular
Liberation Army demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, FARC has been weakened and
most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the
decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling
themselves "Aguilas Negras". Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the
country, narcoterrorism still causes pain in the country. Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field
of battle. Facebook has gained nationwide popularity and has become the birthplace of many civil
movements against narcoterrorism such as "Colombia Soy Yo" (I am Colombia) or "Fundación Un Millón
de Voces" (One Million Voices Foundation), responsible for the international protests against illegal

Naxalite movement is active (2007)
The Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) came to an end when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
finally laid down their arms. More than two million people were displaced from their homes because of the
conflict (well over one-third of the population) many of whom became refugees in neighboring countries. Tens of thousands were killed during
the conflict.[69]
The Sri Lankan Civil War (1983–2009) came to an end after the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Over 80,000
people were killed during the course of the conflict.[70]
Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (2004–present) – an armed conflict between the Pakistani Armed Forces and Islamic militants made up
of local tribesmen, the Taliban, and foreign Mujahideen (Holy Warriors). It began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the Pakistani Army's search
for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan's mountainous Waziristan area (in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas) escalated into armed
resistance by local tribesmen. The violence has displaced 3.44 million civilians[71] and led to more than 7,000 civilians being killed.[72]
The Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), once a major proxy conflict of the Cold War, the conflict ended after the anti-Communist organization
UNITA disbanded to become a political party. By the time the 27-year conflict was formally brought to an end, an estimated 500,000 people
had been killed.[73]
Shia insurgency in Yemen (2004–present) – a civil war in the Sada'a Governorate of Yemen. It began after the Shia Zaidiyyah sect launched
an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government has accused Iran of directing and financing the insurgency.[74]
Thousands of rebels and civilians have been killed during the conflict.[75][76]
Somali Civil War (1991–present)
War in Somalia (2006–2009) – involved largely Ethiopian and Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces who fought against
the Somali Islamist umbrella group, the Islamic Court Union (ICU), and other affiliated militias for control of the country. The war spawned
pirates who hijacked hundreds of ships off the coast of Somalia, holding ships and crew for ransom often for months (see also Piracy in
Somalia). 1.9 million people were displaced from their homes during the conflict[77] and the number of civilian casualties during the
conflict is estimated at 16,724.[78]
Somali civil war (2009–present) – involved largely the forces of the Somali Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) assisted by
African Union peacekeeping troops, whom fought against various militant Islamist factions for control of the country. The violence has
displaced thousands of people residing in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. 1,739 people in total were killed between January 1, 2009, and
January 1, 2010.[79]
Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004–present) – an ongoing conflict in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The conflict was caused due to the
tensions between the foreign oil corporations and a number of the Niger Delta's minority ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited,
particularly the Ogoni and the Ijaw. The competition for oil wealth has led to an endless violence cycle between innumerable ethnic groups,
causing the militarization of nearly the entire region that was occupied by militia groups as well as Nigerian military and the forces of the
Nigerian Police.
Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) – the conflict effectively ended with a government victory, following the surrender of the Islamic Salvation
Army and the 2002 defeat of the Armed Islamic Group. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed during the course of the
conflict.
Civil war in Chad (1998–present)
Chadian Civil War (1998–2002) – involved the Movement for Justice and Democracy in Chad (MDJT) rebels that skirmished periodically
with government troops in the Tibesti region, resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties.
Chadian Civil War (2005–2010) – involved Chadian government forces and several Chadian rebel groups. The Government of Chad
estimated in January 2006 that 614 Chadian citizens had been killed in cross-border raids.[80] The fighting still continues despite several
attempts to reach agreements.
Nepalese Civil War (1996–2006) – the conflict ended with a peace agreement was reached between the government and the Maoist party in
which it was set that the Maoists would take part in the new government in return for surrendering their weapons to the UN. It is estimated
that more than 12,700 people were killed during the course of the conflict.[81]
Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003) – The conflict began in 1999 when a rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD), with support from the Government of Guinea, took over northern Liberia through a coup. In early 2003, a different rebel group, the
Movement for Democracy in Liberia, emerged in the south. As a result, by June–July 2003, president Charles Taylor's government controlled
only a third of the country. The capital Monrovia was besieged by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many
civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.

Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002–present) – Algeria has been the subject of an Islamic insurgency since 2002 waged by the Sunni Islamic
Jihadist militant group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC). GSPC allied itself with the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic
Maghreb against the Algerian government. The conflict has since spread to other neighboring countries.
Ituri conflict (1999–2007) – a conflict fought between the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups in the Ituri region of northeastern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). While there have been many phases to the conflict, the most recent armed clashes ran from 1999 to 2003, with a
low-level conflict continuing until 2007. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the conflict and hundreds of thousands forced from their
homes.[82]
Central African Republic Bush War (2004–2007) – began with the rebellion by the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) rebels, after
the current president of the Central African Republic, François Bozizé, seized power in a 2003 coup. The violence has displaced around
10,000 civilians and has led to hundreds of civilians being killed.
Afghan Civil War (1996–2001) – an armed conflict that continued after the capture of Kabul by the Taliban, in which the formation of the
Afghan Northern Alliance attempted to oust the Taliban. It proved largely unsuccessful, as the Taliban continued to make gains and
eliminated much of the Alliance's leadership.

Coups
The most prominent coup d'état of the decade include:
2000 overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – after Slobodan Milošević
was accused by opposition figures of winning the 2000 election through electoral fraud, mass protests led
by the opposition movement Otpor! pressure Slobodan Milošević to resign. Milošević was later arrested in
2001 and sent to the Hague to face war crimes charges for his alleged involvement in war crimes of the
Yugoslav Wars.
2002 Venezuelan coup attempt – a failed military coup d'état on April 11, 2002, which aimed to overthrow
the president of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. During the coup Hugo Chávez was arrested and Pedro
2006 Thai coup d'état
Carmona became the interim President for 47 hours. The coup led to a pro-Chávez uprising that the
Metropolitan Police attempted to suppress. The pro-Chávez Presidential Guard eventually retook the
Miraflores presidential palace without firing a shot, leading to the collapse of the Carmona government.
2004 Haitian coup d'état – a conflict fought for several weeks in Haiti during February 2004 that resulted in the premature end of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's second term, and the installment of an interim government led by Gérard Latortue.
2006 Thai coup d'état – on September 19, 2006, while the elected Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was in New York for a meeting of
the UN, Army Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Sonthi Boonyaratglin launched a bloodless coup d'état.
Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–present) – an armed conflict fought between the two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas with each
vying to assume political control of the Palestinian territories. In June 2007, Hamas took control of the entire Gaza Strip, and established a
separate government while Fatah remained in control of the West Bank. This in practice divided the Palestinian Authority into two. Various
forces affiliated with Fatah engaged in combat with Hamas, in numerous gun battles. Most Fatah leaders eventually escaped to Egypt and
the West Bank, while some were captured and killed.
2009 Honduran coup d'état – The armed forces of the country entered the president's residence and overthrew president Manuel Zelaya.
(see 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis).

Nuclear threats
Since 2005, Iran's nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the Western world due to
suspicions that Iran could divert the civilian nuclear technology to a weapons program. This has led the
UN Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran on select companies linked to this program, thus
furthering its economic isolation on the international scene. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence said
in February 2009 that Iran would not realistically be able to a get a nuclear weapon until 2013, if it chose
to develop one.[83]
In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq over allegations that its leader Saddam Hussein was stockpiling
weapons of mass destruction including chemical and biological weapons or was in the process of creating
them. None were found, spawning multiple theories.
Anti-aircraft guns guarding Natanz
North Korea successfully performed two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.
Nuclear Facility in Iran
Operation Orchard – during the operation, Israel bombed what was believed to be a Syrian nuclear
reactor on September 6, 2007, which was thought to be built with the aid of North Korea.[84] The White
House and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) later declared that American intelligence indicated the site
was a nuclear facility with a military purpose, though Syria denies this.[85]
The Doomsday Clock, the symbolic representation of the threat of nuclear annihilation, moved four minutes closer to midnight: two minutes in
2002 and two minutes in 2007 to 5 minutes to midnight.

Decolonization and independence
East Timor regains independence from Indonesia in 2002. Portugal granted independence to East Timor in 1975, but it was soon after
invaded by Indonesia, which only recognized East Timorese independence in 2002.
Montenegro gains independence from Serbia in 2006, ending the 88-year-old Yugoslavia.
Kosovo declares independence from Serbia in 2008, though its independence still remains unrecognized by many countries.
On August 23, 2005, Israel's unilateral disengagement from 25 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and West Bank ends.
On August 26, 2008, Russia formally recognises the disputed Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states.[86]
The vast majority of United Nations member states maintain that the areas belong to Georgia.

Political trends
American party system

During the 2000s, the expectations and unspoken rules for acceptable conduct among American politicians affiliated with the Republican or Democratic Parties
changed due to the decline of political bosses in the previous 4 decades and the momentous events in America that happened during the decade.[87]

snow, the largest December snowfall recorded in the city since 1881.
Epidemics
Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the 21st
century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is not especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans).
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This epizootic saw 2,000 cases of the
disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over 6 million sheep and cattle were killed.[119]
Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths
worldwide (9.6% fatality) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37
countries in early 2003.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the Office for National Statistics reported 1,629 MRSA-related deaths in England and Wales during 2005,
indicating a MRSA-related mortality rate half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to
be high because of "improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease" during the time of the 2005 United
Kingdom General Election. MRSA is thought to have caused 1,652 deaths in 2006 in UK up from 51 in 1993.
The 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) flu pandemic was also considered a natural disaster. On October 25, 2009, U.S. President
Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 a national emergency.[120] Despite President Obama's concern, a Fairleigh
Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in October 2009 that an overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans (74%)
were not very worried or not at all worried about contracting the H1N1 flu virus.[121]
A study conducted in coordination with the University of Michigan Health Service is scheduled for publication in the
December 2009 American Journal of Roentgenology warning that H1N1 flu can cause pulmonary embolism, surmised
as a leading cause of death in this current pandemic. The study authors suggest physician evaluation via contrast
enhanced CT scans for the presence of pulmonary emboli when caring for patients diagnosed with respiratory
complications from a "severe" case of the H1N1 flu.[122]

Economics
The most significant evolution of the 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, whose GDP grew
from 1.21 trillion to 5.1 trillion (in 2022 USD).[124] To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom (growing from 438.39 billion to 1.34
trillion)[125] which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force.[126] The rapid catching-up of emerging
economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices
at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with
the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions.[127] The outbreak of
this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.
A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone
owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined.
The combined wealth of the "10 million dollar millionaires" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008.[128]
The sale of UK gold reserves, 1999–2002 was a policy pursued by HM Treasury when gold prices were at their lowest in 20 years, following
an extended bear market. The period itself has been dubbed by some commentators as the Brown Bottom or Brown's
Bottom.[129][130][131][132][133][134]
The period takes its name from Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer (who later became Prime Minister), who decided to sell
approximately half of the UK's gold reserves in a series of auctions. At the time, the UK's gold reserves were worth about US$6.5 billion, accounting for about
half of the UK's US$13 billion foreign currency net reserves.[135]
The 2001 AOL merger with Time Warner (a deal valued at $350 billion; which was the largest merger in American business history)[136] was
'the biggest mistake in corporate history', believes Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes[137]
February 7, 2004 – EuroMillions transnational lottery, launched by France's Française des Jeux, Spain's Loterías y Apuestas del Estado, and
the United Kingdom's Camelot.
In 2007, it was reported that in the UK, one pound in every seven spent went to the Tesco grocery and general merchandise retailer.[138]
On October 9, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at the record level of 14,164.53. Two days later on October 11, the Dow would
trade at its highest intra-day level ever, at the 14,198.10 mark.[139] In what would normally take many years to accomplish; numerous

reasons were cited for the Dow's extremely rapid rise from the 11,000 level in early 2006, to the 14,000 level in late 2007. They included
future possible takeovers and mergers, healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector, and moderate inflationary numbers; fueling
speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. Roughly on par with the 2000 record when adjusted for inflation, this
represented the final high of the cyclical bull. The index closed 2007 at 13,264.82, a level it would not surpass for nearly five years.

Economic growth in the world
Between 1999 and 2009, according to the World Bank statistics for GDP:[140][141]
The world economy by nominal GDP almost doubled in size from U.S. $30.21 trillion in 1999 to U.S.
$58.23 trillion in 2009. This figure is not adjusted for inflation. By PPP, world GDP rose 78%, according to
the IMF. But inflation adjusted nominal GDP rose only 42%, according to IMF constant price growth
rates.[142] The following figures are not inflation adjusted nominal GDP and should be interpreted with
extreme caution:
Shanghai becomes a symbol of the
recent economic boom of China.
The United States (U.S. $14.26 trillion) retained its position of possessing the world's largest economy.
However, the size of its contribution to the total global economy dropped from 28.8% to 24.5% by nominal
price or a fall from 23.8% to 20.4% adjusted for purchasing power.
Japan (U.S. $5.07 trillion) retained its position of possessing the second largest economy in the world, but its contribution to the world
economy also shrank significantly from 14.5% to 8.7% by nominal price or a fall from 7.8% to 6.0% adjusted for purchasing power.
China (U.S. $4.98 trillion) went from being the sixth largest to the third largest economy, and in 2009 contributed to 8.6% of the world's
economy, up from 3.3% in 1999 by nominal price or a rise from 6.9% to 12.6% adjusted for purchasing power.
Germany (U.S. $3.35 trillion), France (U.S. $2.65 trillion), United Kingdom (U.S. $2.17 trillion) and Italy (U.S. $2.11 trillion) followed as the
4th, 5th, 6th and 7th largest economies, respectively in 2009.
Brazil (U.S. $1.57 trillion) retained its position as the 8th largest economy, followed by Spain (U.S. $1.46 trillion), which remained at 10th.
Other major economies included Canada (U.S. $1.34 trillion; 10th, down from 9th), India (U.S. $1.31 trillion; remaining at 11th from 12th),
Russia (U.S. $1.23 trillion; from 16th to 12th) Mexico (U.S. $875 billion; 14th, down from 11th), Australia (U.S. $925 billion; from 14th to 13th)
and South Korea (U.S. $832 billion; 15th, down from 13th).
In terms of purchasing power parity in 2009, the ten largest economies were the United States (U.S. $14.26 trillion), China (U.S. $9.10
trillion), Japan (U.S. $4.14 trillion), India (U.S. $3.75 trillion), Germany (U.S. $2.98 trillion), Russia (U.S. $2.69 trillion), United Kingdom (U.S.
$2.26 trillion), France (U.S. $2.17 trillion), Brazil (U.S. $2.02 trillion), and Italy (U.S. $1.92 trillion).[143][144]
The average house price in the UK, increased by 132% between the fourth quarter of 2000, and 91% during the decade; but the average
salary increased only by 40%.[145]

Globalization and its discontents
The removal of trade and investment barriers, the growth of domestic markets, artificially low currencies, the proliferation of
education, the rapid development of high tech and information systems industries and the growth of the world economy lead to a
significant growth of offshore outsourcing during the decade as many multinational corporations significantly increased
subcontracting of manufacturing (and increasingly, services) across national boundaries in developing countries and particularly
in China and India, due to many benefits and mainly because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the
world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of
this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated capital and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the
United Arab Emirates, Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that
global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which
had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by
countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result,
many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing, computer programming, and
technical support) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.
While global trade rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the WTO in 2001), there was little progress in the
multilateral trading system. International trade continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing
countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies.
However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make much progress, as member countries of the World Trade
Organization did not succeed in finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade.[146] The Doha Round of negotiations,
launched in 2001 by the WTO to promote development, failed to be completed because of growing tensions between regional
areas. Nor did the Cancún Conference in 2003 find a consensus on services trade[147] and agricultural subsidies.[148]

Offshore outsourcing of
jobs, such as this call
centre in India, significantly
increased during the
decade as many
multinational corporations
moved their manufacturing
and services from western
countries to developing
countries.

The comparative rise of China, India, and other developing countries also contributed to their growing clout in international forums. In 2009, it was determined
that the G20, originally a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors, would replace the G8 as the main economic council.
2007 Chinese export recalls – in 2007, a series of product recalls and import bans were imposed by the product safety institutions of the United States,
Canada, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand against products manufactured in and exported from the mainland of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) because of numerous alleged consumer safety issues.
Events in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste, lipstick, and a ban on certain types of seafood. Also
included are reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, slated to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse
consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy.

The age of turbulence
The decade was marked by two financial and economic crises. In 2001, the Dot-com bubble burst, causing turmoil in financial markets and a decline in
economic activity in the developed economies, in particular in the United States.[149] However, the impact of the crisis on the activity was limited thanks to the
intervention of the central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve System. Indeed, Alan Greenspan, leader of the Federal Reserve until 2006, cut the interest

rates several times to avoid a severe recession,[150] allowing an economic revival in the U.S.[151]
As the Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates to favor economic growth, a housing bubble began to appear in the
United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing market caused a wave of loan payment
failures in the U.S. The subsequent mortgage crisis caused a global financial crisis, because the subprime mortgages had
been securitized and sold to international banks and investment funds. Despite the extensive intervention of central
banks, including partial and total nationalization of major European banks,[152][153] the crisis of sovereign debt became
particularly acute, first in Iceland, though as events of the early 2010s would show, it was not an isolated European
example. Economic activity was severely affected around the world in 2008 and 2009,[154] with disastrous consequences
for carmakers.[155]
In 2007, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, delivered his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor
before he moved into Number 10. Addressing financiers: "A new world order has been created", Everyone needed to
follow the city's "great example", "an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age".[156]

Reactions of governments in all developed and developing countries against the economic slowdown were largely
inspired by keynesian economics. The end of the decade was characterized by a Keynesian resurgence,[157] while the influence and media popularity of leftwing economists[158] Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman (Nobel Prize recipients in 2001 and 2008, respectively) did not stop growing during the decade.[159]
Several international summits were organized to find solutions against the economic crisis and to impose greater control on the financial markets. The G20
became in 2008 and 2009 a major organization, as leaders of the member countries held two major summits in Washington in November 2008 and in London in
April 2009 to regulate the banking and financial sectors,[160] and also succeeding in coordinating their economic action and in avoiding protectionist reactions.

Energy crisis
From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally
under $25/barrel. During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by August 11, 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July
2008.[161] Commentators attributed these price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States
Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, Middle East tension,
and oil price speculation.[162]
For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term
effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel
Increase in oil prices
and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plants in 2006 and Hurricane Katrina. By 2008, such pressures appeared to
have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for
energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However, it surged back in May 2009, bringing it
back to November 2008 levels.[163]
Many fast-growing economies throughout the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing
demand for fossil fuels, which—along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil—forced
two other trends: a soar in the price of petroleum products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the
development of environmentally friendly technology (known informally as "green" technology). However, a side-effect of the
push by some industrial nations to "go green" and utilize biofuels was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase
in the price of the same. It partially caused the 2007 food price crisis, which seriously affected the world's poorer nations with an
even more severe shortage of food.[164]

The rise of the euro

A common currency for most EU member states, the euro, was established electronically
in 1999, officially tying all the currencies of each participating nation to each other. The new currency was put into
circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided
not to join the euro (the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the EU undertook a major eastward
enlargement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, Bulgaria and
Romania, joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.

The euro became the currency of
members of the Eurozone.

The euro has since become the second largest reserve currency and the second most traded currency in the world after
the US$.[165] As of October 2009, with more than €790 billion in circulation, the euro was the currency with the highest
combined value of banknotes and coins in circulation in the world, having surpassed the US$.[note 1]

Mathematics
2006 – Grigori Perelman is a Russian mathematician who has made landmark contributions to Riemannian geometry and geometric
topology. In 2003, he proved Thurston's geometrization conjecture. This consequently solved in the affirmative the Poincaré conjecture,
posed in 1904, which before its solution was viewed as one of the most important and difficult open problems in topology. In August 2006,
Perelman was awarded the Fields Medal[167] for "his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and
geometric structure of the Ricci flow." Perelman declined to accept the award or to appear at the congress, stating: "I'm not interested in
money or fame, I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo."[168] On December 22, 2006, the journal Science recognized Perelman's
proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific "Breakthrough of the Year", the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.[169] The
Poincaré conjecture is one of the seven Millennium Problems and the first to be solved.

Technology
Automobiles
Automotive navigation systems become widely popular making it possible to direct vehicles to any destination in real-time as well as detect
traffic and suggest alternate routes with the use of GPS navigation devices.
Greater interest in future energy development due to global warming and the potential exhaustion of crude oil. Photovoltaics increase in
popularity as a result.
The Hybrid vehicles market, which became somewhat popular towards the middle of the decade, underwent major advances notably typified
by such cars as the Toyota Prius, Ford Escape, and the Honda Insight though by December 2010 they accounted for less than 0.5% of the
world cars.
Many more computers and other technologies were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: Xenon HID headlights, GPS,
DVD players, self-diagnosing systems, memory systems for car settings, back-up sensors and cameras, in-car media systems, MP3 player
compatibility, USB drive compatibility, keyless start and entry, satellite radio, voice-activation, cellphone connectivity, HUD (Head-Up-Display)
and infrared cameras. In addition, more safety features were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: advanced pre-collision
safety systems, Backup cameras, Blind spot monitor, Adaptive cruise control, Adaptive headlamps, Automatic parking, Lane departure
warning systems and the Advanced Automatic Collision Notification system Onstar (on all GM models).
The sale of Crossovers (CUVs), a type of car-based unibody sports utility vehicle, increased in the 2000s.[175] By 2006, the segment came
into strong visibility in the U.S., when crossover sales "made up more than 50% of the overall SUV market".[176]

Communications
The popularity of mobile phones and text messaging surged in the 2000s in the Western world. The
advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before, leading to
positive implications such as having the ability to receive information on the move. Nevertheless, it also
led to negative social implications such as "cyberbullying" and the rise of traffic collisions caused by
drivers who were distracted as they were texting while driving.
Mobile internet, first launched in Japan with the i-mode in 1999, became increasingly popular with people
in developed countries throughout the decade, thanks to improving cell phone capabilities and advances
in mobile telecommunications technology, such as 3G.
The popularity of mobile phones and
E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade. It began to replace "snail mail" (also known, more
text messaging surged in the 2000s
neutrally, as paper mail, postal mail, land mail, or simply mail or post) as the primary way of sending
letters and other messages to people in faraway locations, though it has been available since 1971.
in the Western world.
Social networking sites arose as a new way for people to stay in touch no matter where they are, as long
as they have an internet connection. The earliest social networking sites were Friendster, Myspace,
Facebook, and Twitter in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009
when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users.[177]
Smartphones, which combine mobile phones with the features of personal digital assistants and portable media players, first emerged in the
1990s but did not become popular until the late 2000s. Smartphones are rich in features and often have high resolution touchscreens and
web browsers. The first modern smartphone was the iPhone 2G. It was released in June 2007 in the United States, and in November 2007,
the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Portugal, Ireland and Austria. It was the first smartphone to not include a physical keyboard, solely
utilizing a touch screen and a home button.
Due to the major success of broadband Internet connections, VoIP starts to gain popularity as a replacement for traditional telephone lines.
Computing and Internet
In the 2000s, the Internet became a mainstay, strengthening its grip on Western society while becoming increasingly available in the developing world. The
share of the world population using the internet grew from 6.7% to 25.7%.[178]
A huge jump in broadband internet usage globally – for example, from 6% of U.S. internet users in June
2000[179] to what one mid-decade study predicted would be 62% by 2010.[180] By February 2007, over
80% of U.S. Internet users were connected via broadband and broadband internet has been almost a
required standard for quality internet browsing.[181]
Wireless internet became prominent by the end of the decade, as well as internet access in devices

visited website.
Email became a standard form of interpersonal written communication, with popular addresses available
to the public on Hotmail (now Outlook.com), Gmail and Yahoo! Mail.
Normalisation became increasingly important as massive standardized corpora and lexicons of spoken and written language became widely
available to laypeople, just as documents from the paperless office were archived and retrieved with increasing efficiency using XML-based

markup.
Peer-to-peer technology gained massive popularity with file sharing systems enabling users to share any audio, video and data files or
anything in digital format, as well as with applications which share real-time data, such as telephony traffic.
VPNs (virtual private networks) became likewise accessible to the general public, and data encryption remained a major issue for the stability
of web commerce.
Boom in music downloading and the use of data compression to quickly transfer music over the Internet, with a corresponding rise of
portable digital audio players. As a result, the entertainment industry struggled through the decade to find digital delivery systems for music,
movies, and other media that reduce copyright infringement and preserve profit.
The USB flash drive replaces the floppy disk as the preferred form of low-capacity mobile data storage.
In February 2003, Dell announced floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on Dell Dimension home computers, although they were still
available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM add-on.[182] On January 29, 2007, PC World stated that only 2% of
the computers they sold contained built-in floppy disk drives; once present stocks were exhausted, no more standard floppies would be
sold.[183]
During the decade, Windows 2000, XP, Microsoft Office 2003, Vista and Office 2007 (and later Windows 7) become the ubiquitous industry
standards in personal computer software until the end of the decade, when Apple began to slowly gain market share. Windows ME and
Microsoft Office XP were also released during the decade.
With the advent of the Web 2.0, dynamic technology became widely accessible, and by the mid-2000s, PHP and MySQL became (with
Apache and nginx) the backbone of many sites, making programming knowledge unnecessary to publish to the web. Blogs, portals, and
wikis become common electronic dissemination methods for professionals, amateurs, and businesses to conduct knowledge management
typified by success of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which launched on January 15, 2001, grew rapidly and became the largest and
most popular general reference work on the Internet[184][185] as well as the best known wiki in the world and the largest encyclopedia in the
world.
Open-source software, such as the Linux operating system, the Mozilla Firefox web browser and VLC media player, gain ground.
Internet commerce became standard for reservations; stock trading; promotion of music, arts, literature, and film; shopping; and other
activities.
During this decade certain websites and search engines became prominent worldwide as transmitters of goods, services and information.
Some of the most popular and successful online sites or search engines of the 2000s included Google, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, eBay,
MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
More and more businesses began providing paperless services, clients accessing bills and bank statements directly through a web interface.
In 2007, the fast food chain McDonald's announced the introduction of free high speed wireless internet access at most of its 1,200
restaurants by the end of the year in a move which will make it the UK's biggest provider of such a service.[186]
Popular websites
Google, YouTube, Ask.com and Wikipedia emerged as popular websites, becoming the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 9th most popular websites by the end of the decade
respectively. Amazon overtook eBay as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from
being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite and Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN fell from the second to sixth most
popular site, though it quadrupled its monthly visits (going from 325 to 1.2 billion monthly visits). Yahoo! maintained relatively stable popularity, remaining
the most popular website for most of the decade.[187]
Electronics
GPS (Global Positioning System) became very popular especially in the tracking of items or people, and
the use in cars (see Automotive navigation systems). Games that utilized the system, such as
geocaching, emerged and became popular.
Green laser pointers[189] appeared on the market circa 2000, and are the most common type of DPSS
lasers (also called DPSSFD for "diode pumped solid state frequency-doubled").
In late 2004 and early 2005, came a significant increase in reported incidents linked to laser pointers – see Lasers and
aviation safety. The wave of incidents may have been triggered in part by "copycats" who read press accounts of laser
pointer incidents. In one case, David Banach of New Jersey was charged under federal Patriot Act anti-terrorism laws,
after he allegedly shone a laser pointer at aircraft.[190]
Chip and PIN is the brand name adopted by the banking industries in the United Kingdom and Ireland for
the rollout of the EMV smart card payment system for credit, debit and ATM cards.

The rise of MP3 players,
downloadable music, and cellular
ringtones in the mid-2000s ended
the decade-long dominance that the
CD held up to that point.[188]

Chip and PIN was trialled in Northampton, England from May 2003, and as a result was rolled out nationwide in the
United Kingdom in 2004 with advertisements in the press and national television touting the "Safety in Numbers"
slogan.
In 2009, Tesco (a British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer) opened its first UK branch at which service robots were the
only option at the checkout, in Kingsley, Northampton – its US chain, Fresh & Easy, already operates several branches like this.[191]
September 7, 2009, an EU watchdog warns of an "alarming increase" in cash machine fraud by organised criminal gangs across Europe
using sophisticated skimming technology, together with an explosion in ram-raiding attacks on ATMs.
ATM crime in Europe jumped to €485m (£423m) in 2008 following a 149% rise in attacks on cash machines. Gangs are turning to Bluetooth wireless
technology to transmit card and personal identification number (PIN) details to nearby laptops and using increasingly sophisticated techniques to skim cards.
Portable laptops became popular during the late 2000s.
More conventional smash-and-grab attacks are also on the rise, says Enisa, the European Network and Information Security Agency. It reports a 32% rise in
physical robberies on ATMs, ranging from ram raids to the use of rotary saws, blowtorches and diamond drills. It blames the increase on criminal gangs from
eastern Europe.[192]

Transportation
Competition between Airbus and Boeing, the two largest remaining airliner manufacturers, intensified, with panEuropean Airbus outselling American Boeing for the first time during this decade.[193]
Airbus launched the double-decker Airbus A380, the largest passenger aircraft ever to enter production.[194]
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first mass-production aircraft manufactured primarily with composite materials,
had its maiden flight.[195]
Production of the Boeing 757, Boeing's largest single-aisle airliner, ended with no replacement.[196]
The Concorde, a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner or supersonic transport (SST), was retired in 2003
due to a general downturn in the aviation industry after the type's only crash in 2000, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in
2001 and a decision by Airbus, the successor firm of Aerospatiale and BAC, to discontinue maintenance support.
December 9, 2005 – The London Transport Executive AEC Routemaster double-decker bus was officially withdrawn

Video
Digital cameras become widely popular due to rapid decreases in size and cost while photo resolution steadily increases. As a result, the
digital cameras largely supplanted the analog cameras and the integration into mobile phones increase greatly. Since 2007, digital cameras
started being manufactured with the face recognition feature built in.[202]
Flat panel displays started becoming widely popular in the second half of the decade displacing cathode-ray tubes.[203][204]
Handheld projectors enter the market and are then integrated into cellphones.[205]
DVR devices such as TiVo became popular, making it possible to record television broadcasts to a hard drive-based digital storage medium
and allowing many additional features including the option to fast-forward through commercials or to use an automatic Commercial skipping
feature. This feature created controversy, with major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright and should be
banned. With the commercial skipping feature, many television channels place advertisements on the bottom on the TV screen.[206]
VOD technology became widely available among cable users worldwide, enabling the users to select and watch video content from a large
variety of available content stored on a central server, as well as gaining the possibility to freeze the image, as well as fast-forward and
rewind the VOD content.
DVDs, and subsequently Blu-ray Discs, replace VCR technology as the common standard in homes and at video stores.[207]
Free Internet video portals like YouTube, Hulu, and Internet TV software solutions like Joost became new popular alternatives to TV
broadcasts.[208]
TV becomes available on the networks run by some mobile phone providers, such as Verizon Wireless's Vcast.
"High-definition television" becomes very popular towards the second half of the decade, with the increase of HD television channels and the
conversion from analog to digital signals.[209]

Prominent events and trends during the 2000s:
Increasing Islamophobia and Islamophobic incidents during the 2000s associated with the September 11 attacks
or with the increased presence of Muslims in the Western world.[211][212][213]

In 2000, the Italian Supreme Court ruled that Scientology is a religion for legal purposes.[214][215]
In 2001, lawsuits were filed in the United States and Ireland, alleging that some priests had sexually abused minors and that their superiors
had conspired to conceal and otherwise abet their criminal misconduct.[216] In 2004, the John Jay report tabulated a total of 4,392 priests and
deacons in the U.S. against whom allegations of sexual abuse had been made.
The French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools bans wearing conspicuous religious symbols in French public
(i.e. government-operated) primary and secondary schools; and came into effect on September 2, 2004.
June 27, 2005, – The Supreme Court of the United States ruled on in a 5–4 decision, that a Ten Commandments display at the McCreary
County courthouse in Whitley City, Kentucky and a Ten Commandments display at the Pulaski County courthouse—were unconstitutional:
McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union
France created in 2006 the first French parliamentary commission on cult activities which led to a report registering a number of cults
considered as dangerous. Supporters of such movements have criticized the report on the grounds of the respect of religious freedom.
Proponents of the measure contend that only dangerous cults have been listed as such, and state secularism ensures religious freedom in
France.
November 2009 – Minaret controversy in Switzerland: A referendum, a constitutional amendment banning the construction of new Mosque
minarets was approved, sparking reactions from governments and political parties throughout of the world.
2009 – In Pope Benedict XVI's third encyclical Caritas in Veritate, he warns that a purely technocrat mindset where decisions are made only
on grounds of efficiency will not deliver true development. Technical decisions must not be divorced from ethics. Benedict discusses bioethics
and states that practices such as abortion, eugenics and euthanasia are morally hazardous and that accepting them can lead to greater
tolerance for various forms of moral degradation. He turns to another consequence of the technocratic mindset, the viewing of people's
personalities in purely psychological terms at the exclusion of the spiritual, which he says can lead to people feeling empty and abandoned
even in prosperous societies.

Population and social issues
The decade saw further expansion of LGBTQ+ rights, with many European, Oceanic, and American countries recognizing civil unions and
partnerships and a number of countries extending civil marriage to same-sex couples. The Netherlands was the first country in the world to
legalize same-sex marriage in 2001. By the end of 2009, same-sex marriage was legal and performed in 10 countries worldwide, although
only in some jurisdictions in Mexico and the United States.
Population continued to grow in most countries, in particular in developing countries, though overall the rate slowed. According to United
Nations estimates, world population reached six billion in late 1999,[217] and continued to climb to 6.8 billion in late 2009.[218] In 2007 the
population of the United States reached 300 million inhabitants, and Japan's population peaked at 127 million before going into decline.[219]
In a 2003 memo to a staff member, Britain's Charles, Prince of Wales wrote:
What is wrong with everyone nowadays? Why do they all seem to think they are qualified to do things far beyond their technical
capabilities? This is to do with the learning culture in schools as a consequence of a child-centred system that admits no failure.
People think they can all be pop stars, high court judges, brilliant TV personalities or infinitely more competent heads of state
without ever putting in the necessary work or having natural ability. This is the result of social utopianism which believes humanity
can be genetically and socially engineered to contradict the lessons of history ...[220]
Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of
the most serious public health problems of the 21st century.[221]
In 2001, 46.4% of people in sub-Saharan Africa were living in extreme poverty.[222] Nearly half of all Indian children are undernourished,
however, even among the wealthiest fifth one third of children are malnourished.[223][224]
5 A Day is the name of a number of programs in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, to encourage the
consumption of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, following a recommendation by the World Health Organization that
individuals consume at least 400 g of vegetables daily.[225]
The programme was introduced by the UK Department of Health in the winter of 2002–2003, and received some adverse media attention
because of the high and rising costs of fresh fruit and vegetables. After ten years, research suggested that few people were meeting the
target.[226]

The London congestion charge is a fee charged on most motor vehicles operating within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ) in central
London between 07:00 and 18:00 Monday to Friday. It is not charged at weekends, public holidays or between Christmas Day and New
Year's Day (inclusive). The charge, which was introduced on February 17, 2003, remains one of the largest congestion charge zones in the
world.
On December 3, 2003, New Zealand passed legislation to progressively implement a smoking ban in schools, school grounds, and
workplaces by December 2004.[227] On March 29, 2004, Ireland implemented a nationwide ban on smoking in all workplaces. In Norway,
similar legislation was put into force on June 1 the same year. Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in
2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into effect (the age limit for buying tobacco was also raised from 16
to 18 on October 1, 2007). From 2004 to 2009, the UK's Merseyside police officers, conducted 1,389 section 60 stop and searches (without
reasonable suspicion), rising to 23,138 within five years.[228]
In 2005 the cost of alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more
than cancer and obesity.[229]
The number of antidepressants prescribed by the NHS in the United Kingdom almost doubled during one decade, authorities reported in
2010. In 2009, 39.1 million prescriptions for drugs to tackle depression were issued in England, compared with 20.1 million issued in
1999.[230]
In the United States a 2005 independent report stated that 11% of women and 5% of men in the non-institutionalized population (2002) take
antidepressants. The use of antidepressants in the United States doubled over one decade, from 1996 to 2005.[231]
Antidepressant drugs were prescribed to 13 million in 1996 and to 27 million people by 2005. In 2008, more than 164 million prescriptions
were written.[231]
In the UK, the number of weddings in 2006 was the lowest for 110 years.[232]
Jamie Oliver, is a British chef, restaurateur, media personality, known for his food-focused television shows and cookbooks. In 2006, Oliver
began a formal campaign to ban unhealthy food in British schools and to get children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring
radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing
schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed eating.[233] Jamie's efforts brought the subject of school dinners to the
political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.[234]
In 2006, nearly 11 million Plastic surgery procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures
performed in the United States has increased over 50 percent since the start of the century.[235]
In November 2006, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) announced that it would ban television advertisements for junk food before, during
and after television programming aimed at under-16s in the United Kingdom.[236] These regulations were originally outlined in a proposal
earlier in the year. This move has been criticized on both ends of the scale; while the Food and Drink Federation labelled the ban "over the
top", others have said the restrictions do not go far enough (particularly due to the fact that soap operas would be exempt from the ban).[237]
On April 1, 2007, junk food advertisements were banned from programmes aimed at four to nine-year-olds.[238] Such advertisements
broadcast during programmes "aimed at, or which would appeal to," ten to fifteen-year-olds will continue to be phased out over the coming
months,[239] with a full ban coming into effect on January 1, 2009.[238]
November 10, 2006 – referring to the UK's annual poppy appeal, British journalist and presenter Jon Snow condemned the attitude of those
who insist remembrance poppies are worn. He claimed: there is a rather unpleasant breed of poppy fascism out there.[240]
In January 2007, the British Retail Consortium announced that major UK retailers, including Asda, Boots, Co-op, Iceland, Marks and
Spencer, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose intended to cease adding trans fatty acids to their own products by the end of 2007.[241]
In October 2008 AFP reported on the further expansion of killings of albinos to the Ruyigi region of Burundi. Body parts of the victims are then
smuggled to Tanzania, where they are used for witch doctor rituals and potions.[242] Albinos have become "a commercial good", commented
Nicodeme Gahimbare in Ruyigi, who established a local safe haven in his fortified house.[242]
A 2009 study found a 30% increase in Chinese diabetes over 7 years.[243]
AIDS continued to expand during the decade, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. New diseases of animal origin appeared for a short time, such
as the bird flu in 2007.[244] Swine flu was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2009.[245]

Environment and climate change
Climate change and global warming became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored
organisations such as the IPCC gained influence, and studies such as the Stern report influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of
countering climate change.
The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the 2000s might
have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade.[246][247] The NASA
and the NOAA later echoed the WMO's findings.[248]
Major natural disasters became more frequent and helped change public opinion. One of the deadliest heat waves in
human history happened during the 2000s, mostly in Europe, with the 2003 European heat wave killing 37,451 people
over the summer months.[249] In February 2009, a series of highly destructive bushfires started in Victoria, Australia,
lasting into the next month. While the fires are believed to have been caused by arson, they were widely reported as
having been fueled by an excessive heatwave that was due in part to climate change. It has also been alleged that climate
change was a cause of increased storms intensity, notably in the case of Hurricane Katrina.

International actions

Scientific studies on climate helped

Climate change became a major issue for governments, populations and scientists. Debates on global warming and its
establish a consensus.
causes made significant progress, as climate change denials were refuted by most scientific studies. Decisive reports
such as the Stern Review and the 2007 IPCC Report almost established a climate change consensus.[250] NGOs' actions
and the commitment of political personalities (such as former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) also urged to international reactions against climate change.
Documentary films An Inconvenient Truth and Home may have had a decisive impact.[251]

Under the auspices of The UN Convention on Climate Change the Kyoto Protocol (aimed at combating global warming) entered into force on February 16,
2005. As of November 2009, 187 states have signed and ratified the protocol.[252] In addition The UN Convention on Climate Change helped coordinate the
efforts of the international community to fight potentially disastrous effects of human activity on the planet and launched negotiations to set an ambitious
program of carbon emission reduction that began in 2007 with the Bali Road Map. However, the representatives of the then 192 member countries of the
United Nations gathered in December 2009 for the Copenhagen Conference failed to reach a binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions because of
divisions between regional areas.
However, as environmental technologies were to make up a potential market, some countries made large investments in renewable energies, energy
conservation and sustainable transport. Many governments launched national plans to promote sustainable energy. In 2003, the European Union members
created an emission trading scheme, and in 2007 they assembled a climate and energy package to reduce further their carbon emission and improve their
energy-efficiency. In 2009, the United States Obama administration set up the Green New Deal, a plan to create millions of jobs in sectors related to
environmentalism.
The Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 requires local authorities in England to provide every household with a separate collection of at least two types of
recyclable materials by 2010.[253]

Journalism
"It was, we were soon told, 'the day that changed everything', the 21st century's defining moment, the watershed by which we would forever
divide world history: before, and after, 9/11." ~ The Guardian[386]
The BBC's foreign correspondent John Simpson on Rupert Murdoch (March 15, 2010):

I do think that he and the newspapers he's run have introduced an uglier side, an abusive side, into journalism and life in general in
this country.
He says this Murdochisation of national discourse, which was at its height in the UK with The Sun in the 1980s, has now migrated to the US.
"Murdoch encouraged an ugly tone, which he has now imported into the US and which we see every day on Fox News, with all its
concomitant effects on American public life – that fierce hostility between right and left that never used to be there, not to anything remotely
like the same extent."[387]
October 2001, Canadian author and social activist known for her political analyses Naomi Klein's book titled Fences and Windows:
On September 11, [2001] watching TV replays of the buildings exploding over and over again in New York and Washington, I
couldn't help thinking about all the times media coverage has protected us from similar horrors elsewhere. During the Gulf War, for
instance, we didn't see real buildings exploding or people fleeing, we saw a sterile Space Invader battlefield, a bomb's-eye view of
concrete targets – there and then none. Who was in those abstract polygons? We never found out.[388]
May 15, 2003, Fox News Channel's (which grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant cable news network in the United
States.[389]) political commentator Bill O'Reilly's "The Talking Points Memo", from his The O'Reilly Factor television talk show:
So, Talking Points urges the Pentagon to stop the P.R. dance and impose strict rules of conduct for the Iraqi people to follow. Lawabiding Iraqis want that. It's only the gangsters and the fanatics who don't. Shoot looters to kill, and aim well.
And that's The Memo.[390]
A poll released in 2004, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, found that 21 percent of people aged 18 to 29 cited The
Daily Show (an American late night satirical television program airing each Monday through Thursday) and Saturday Night Live (an American
late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show) as a place where they regularly learned presidential campaign news. By contrast,
23 percent of the young people mentioned ABC, CBS or NBC's nightly news broadcasts as a source. When the same question was asked in
2000, Pew found only 9 percent of young people pointing to the comedy shows, and 39 percent to the network news shows. One newspaper,
Newsday, has The Daily Show's host Jon Stewart, listed atop a list of the 20 media players who will most influence the upcoming presidential
campaign. Random conversations with nine people, aged 19 to 26, waiting to see a taping of The Daily Show, revealed two who admitted
they learned much about the news from the program. None said they regularly watched the network evening news shows.[391]
The Guardian, is a British national daily newspaper. In August 2004, for the US presidential election, The Guardian's daily "G2" supplement
launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in Clark County, Ohio, an average-sized county in a swing state. G2 editor Ian Katz bought
a voter list from the county for $25 and asked readers to write to people listed as undecided in the election, giving them an impression of the
international view and the importance of voting against US President George W. Bush. The paper scrapped "Operation Clark County" on
October 21, 2004, after first publishing a column of complaints from Bush supporters about the campaign under the headline "Dear Limey
assholes".[392] The public backlash against the campaign likely contributed to Bush's victory in Clark County.[393]
March 2005 – Twenty MPs signed a British House of Commons motion condemning the BBC Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman for
saying that "a sort of Scottish Raj" was running the UK. Mr Paxman likened the dominance of Scots at Westminster to past British rule in
India.[394]
August 1, 2007 – News Corp. and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The US$5 billion sale added the largest
newspaper in the United States, by circulation The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's news empire.
August 30, 2008 – three years before the 2011 England riots, The Socialist Worker wrote: "Those who have responded to the tragedy of knife
crime by calling for police crackdowns ought to take note. The criminalisation of a generation of black youth will undoubtedly lead to
explosions of anger in the future, just as it did a generation ago with the riots that swept Britain's inner cities."[395]
Ann Coulter is an American conservative social and political commentator, eight-time best-selling author, syndicated columnist, and lawyer.
She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events. As the 2008 US presidential campaign was
getting under way, Coulter was criticised for statements she made at the 2007 Conservative Political Action Conference about presidential
candidate John Edwards:[396][397]
I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, but it turns out that you have to
go into rehab if you use the word 'faggot,' so I'm... so, kind of at an impasse, can't really talk about Edwards, so I think I'll just
conclude here and take your questions.
In December 2008, Time magazine named Barack Obama as its Person of the Year for his historic candidacy and election, which it described
as "the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments".[398]

Print media
The decade saw the steady decline of sales of print media such as books, magazines, and newspapers, as the main conveyors of
information and advertisements, in favor of the Internet and other digital forms of information.[399][400][401]
News blogs grew in readership and popularity; cable news and other online media outlets became competitive in attracting advertising
revenues and capable journalists and writers are joining online organizations. Books became available online, and electronic devices such as
Amazon Kindle threatened the popularity of printed books.[402][403]
According to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the decade showed a continuous increase in reading, although circulation of
newspapers has declined.[404]

Radio
The 2000s saw a decrease in the popularity of radio as more listeners starting using MP3 players in their cars to customize driving music. Satellite radio
receivers started selling at a much higher rate, which allowed listeners to pay a subscription fee for thousands of ad-free stations. Clear Channel
Communications was the largest provider of radio entertainment in the United States with over 900 stations nationwide. Many radio stations began streaming
their content over the Internet, allowing a market expansion far beyond the reaches of a radio transmitter.

During the 2000s, FM radio faced its toughest competition ever for in-car entertainment. iPod, satellite radio, and HD radio were all new options for
commuters. CD players had a steady decline in popularity throughout the 2000s but stayed prevalent in most vehicles, while cassette tapes became virtually
obsolete.
August 27, 2001 – Hot 97 shock jock Star (real name Troi Torain) was suspended indefinitely for mocking R&B singer Aaliyah's death on the
air. by playing a tape of a woman screaming while a crash is heard in the background. Close to 32,000 people signed a "No More Star"
online petition.[405]
In a 2008 edition of his (American) radio show, John Gibson commented on Australian actor Heath Ledger's death the day before. He opened
the segment with funeral music and played a clip of Jake Gyllenhaal's famous line "I wish I knew how to quit you" from Ledger's film
Brokeback Mountain; he then said "Well, I guess he found out how to quit you." Among other remarks, Gibson called Ledger a "weirdo" with
"a serious drug problem".[406] The next day, he addressed outcry over his remarks by saying that they were in the context of jokes he had
been making for months about Brokeback Mountain, and that "There's no point in passing up a good joke."[407] Gibson later apologized on
his television and radio shows.[408][409]


Video games
Video-game hardware and software
The world of video games reached the 6th generation of video game consoles including the PlayStation 2, the Xbox, and the GameCube, which started
technically in 1998 with the release of Sega's Dreamcast, although some consider the true start in 2000 with the release of Sony's PlayStation 2. The 6th gen
remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with
the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360, however, most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including
the Xbox even though the 360 was already released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true
start of the 7th gen. It reached 7th Generation in the form of consoles like the Wii, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by the mid-2000s. The number-one-selling

game console of the decade, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000 and remained popular up to the end of the decade,
even after the PlayStation 3 was released. The PlayStation 2 was discontinued in January 2013. The Nintendo DS
launched in Japan in 2004 and by 2005 was available globally. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold over 154.02
million units, thus making it the best selling handheld of all time and the second best selling video game console of all
time behind the PlayStation 2.[425][426]
Neo Geo is a family of video game hardware developed by SNK. The brand originated in 1990 with the release of an
arcade system, the Neo Geo MVS and its home console counterpart, the Neo Geo AES. The Neo Geo brand was
officially discontinued in 2004.
MMORPGs, originating in the mid-to-late 1990s, become a popular PC trend and virtual online worlds become a reality
as games such as RuneScape (2001), Final Fantasy XI (2002), Eve Online (2003), Tony Hawk's Underground (2003),
World of Warcraft (2004), and EverQuest II (2004), The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar (2007) and
Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (2008) are released. These worlds come complete with their own economies and
social organization as directed by the players as a whole. The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular
for many years. World of Warcraft, premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still
being developed into the 2010s.
Arcade video games had declined in popularity so much by the late 1990s, that revenues in the United States dropped to
$1.33 billion in 1999,[427] and reached a low of $866 million in 2004.[428] Furthermore, by the early 2000s, networked
gaming via computers and then consoles across the Internet had also appeared,[429] replacing the venue of head-to-head
competition and social atmosphere once provided solely by arcades.[430]

PlayStation 2 was released in 2000
and became the best-selling gaming
console of the decade and of all
time.

First Xbox released in 2001

Cross-platform Game engines originating in the very late-1990s, became extremely popular in the 2000s, as they
allowed development for indie games for digital distribution. Noteworthy software include GameMaker and Unity. Wellknown indie games made in that decade include I Wanna Be the Guy, Spelunky, Braid, Clean Asia!, Castle Crashers,
World of Goo, Dino Run, The Impossible Game and Alien Hominid.
In the late 2000s, motion controlled video games grew in popularity, from the PlayStation 2's EyeToy to Nintendo's
successful Wii console. During the decade 3D video games become the staple of the video-game industry, with 2D
GameCube released in 2001 and is
games nearly fading from the market. Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the
the successor to the Nintendo 64
decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the
increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often
produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as Minecraft and Shadow Complex. These games, which are not developed by the
industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as Microsoft's Xbox Live or Apple's App Store and usually cost
much less than more major releases.
Prominent video-games
The Grand Theft Auto series sparked a fad of Mature-rated video games based on including gang warfare, drug use, and
perceived "senseless violence" into gameplay. Though violent video games date back to the early 1990s, they became
much more common after 2000. Despite the controversy, the 2004 game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas became the
best selling PlayStation 2 game of all time, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5
million in all formats by 2009;[431] as of 2011, 27.5 million copies of San Andreas were sold worldwide.[432]
The Call of Duty series was extremely popular during the 2000s, the diverse shooter franchise released multiple games
throughout the 2000s that were positively critically reviewed and commercially successful.
The Sims series developed by Maxis became one of the most popular life simulation games series with over 200 million
copies sold worldwide since the series' first game was released in 2000.[434]
Gears of War was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful third-person shooter franchise that released two
games during the mid-late 2000s. Gears of War 1 was released in 2006 and was the first installment to the franchise, it
was universally critically acclaimed and went on to sell over 5 million copies. The second installment to the franchise
Gears of War 2 was released in 2008 and received widespread critical acclaim and also went on to sell over 5 million
copies.

Game Boy Advance SP is upgraded
version of the original Game Boy
Advance system and it is the
second last Game Boy handheld

Manhunt 2, a controversial stealth-based psychological horror video game published by Rockstar Games, was suspended
by Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) when it was refused classification in the United Kingdom, Italy
and Ireland, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States. As neither Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo allow
AO titles on their systems, it made Rockstar bring the game down to a Mature (M) game and release in October 2007.
The sixth generation sparked a rise in first person shooter games led by Halo: Combat Evolved, which changed the
formula of the first person shooter. Halo 2 started online console gaming and was on top of the Xbox Live charts until its
successor, Halo 3 (for Xbox 360), took over. Some other popular first-person shooters during the 2000s include the
Medal of Honor series, with Medal of Honor: Frontline 's release in 2002 bringing the first game in the series to 6th
generation consoles.

The Nintendo DS awakened an
interest in casual play that had
never really existed before.[433]

Dance Dance Revolution was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers. Other dance games like Just
Dance was released in 2009 and went on to be the most popular game from Nintendo all over the world. Another music game, Guitar Hero, was released in
North America in late 2005 and had a huge cultural impact on both the music and video games industries. It became a worldwide billion-dollar franchise within
three years, spawning several sequels and leading to the creation of a competing franchise, Rock Band.

Gaming industry
Worldwide, arcade game revenues gradually increased from $1.8 billion in 1998 to $3.2 billion in 2002, rivalling PC
game sales of $3.2 billion that same year.[435] In particular, arcade video games are a thriving industry in China, where
arcades are widespread across the country.[436] The US market has also experienced a slight resurgence, with the number
of video game arcades across the nation increasing from 2,500 in 2003 to 3,500 in 2008, though this is significantly less
than the 10,000 arcades in the early 1980s. As of 2009, a successful arcade game usually sells around 4000 to 6000 units
worldwide.[437]

PlayStation Portable (PSP-1000)
Sony handheld games console

Japanese media giant Nintendo released 9 out of the 10 top selling games of the 2000s, further establishing the
company's dominance over the market.[438]
Sega Corporation, usually styled as SEGA, is a Japanese multinational video game software developer and an arcade software and hardware development
company headquartered in Japan, with various offices around the world. Sega previously developed and manufactured its own brand of home video game
consoles from 1983 to 2001, but a restructure was announced on January 31, 2001, that ceased continued production of its existing home console (Dreamcast),
effectively exiting the company from the home console business.[439] In spite of that, SEGA would go on to produce several videogames such as Super Monkey
Ball franchise, the Sega Ages 2500 PlayStation 2 games,[440] Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Rez, Shadow the Hedgehog,
Virtua Fighter 4, After Burner Climax, Valkyria Chronicles, Sonic Pinball Party, Bayonetta, Jet Set Radio, Puyo Pop Fever, Thunder Force VI, Shenmue II,
Phantasy Star Online, Yakuza 2, Gunstar Super Heroes, Astro Boy: Omega Factor, OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic
Games.[441]

Writing
The decade saw the rise of digital media as opposed to the use of print, and the steady decline of printed books in countries where e-readers
had become available.
The deaths of John Updike, Hunter S. Thompson, and other authors marked the end of various major writing careers influential during the
late 20th century.
Popular book series such as Harry Potter, Twilight and Dan Brown's "Robert Langdon" (consisting of Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code,
and The Lost Symbol) saw increased interest in various genres such as fantasy, romance, vampire fiction, and detective fiction, as well as
young adult fiction in general.
Manga (also known as Japanese comics) became popular among the international audience, mostly in English-speaking countries. Such
popular manga works include Lucky Star, Fullmetal Alchemist and Naruto.
On July 19, 2001, English author and former politician, Jeffrey Archer, was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at a
1987 libel trial. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.
Peter Pan in Scarlet is a novel by Geraldine McCaughrean. It is an official sequel to Scottish author and dramatist J. M. Barrie's Peter and
Wendy, authorised by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to whom Barrie granted all rights to the character and original writings in 1929.
McCaughrean was selected following a competition launched in 2004, in which novelists were invited to submit a sample chapter and plot
outline.[444]
J. K. Rowling was the best-selling author in the decade overall thanks to the Harry Potter book series,[445] although she did not pen the bestselling book (at least in the UK), being second to The Da Vinci Code,[445] which had 5.2 million in the UK by 2009[445] and 80 million
worldwide by 2012.[446]

saving the lives of the Israeli citizens who continue to be targeted
by the terrorist campaign that began in 2000. The fact that over 800
men, women and children have been killed in horrific suicide
bombings and other terror attacks clearly justifies the attempt to
place a physical barrier in the path of terrorists.... terrorism has
been defined throughout the international community as a crime
against humanity. As such, the State of Israel not only has the right

attacks in 2006 than in any year since the Palestinian uprising
began in 2000. Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign
visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height
of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in
Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide
bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11
people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months
without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period
without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military
spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been
Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing 250-mile
(400 km) network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other
obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security
fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said
Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...]
Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it has been
effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route
should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian
territories known as the Green Line. [...] IDF spokeswoman Meir
said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning
attacks from the West Bank also deserved credit for the drop in
Israeli fatalities."
