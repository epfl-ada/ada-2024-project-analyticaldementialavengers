# The metamorphosis of Movie Archetypes: A timeless tale of film personas

## Abstract
A given historical context has a high influence on the topics approached in its contemporary movies. Typically, the Japanese animes were a catharsis of the traumas caused by the Second World War to the Japanese population. In this research, we want to test if it is true for the characters portrayed in the movies as well. Has each era a stereotypical character derived from time corresponding historical events (i.e. : are more soldiers characters presented after war events or more astronauts during the space exploration period) ? We aim to create a time journey in which we will meet those time stereotypes and, maybe, given our own historical context, be able to predict what is the incoming character movie star that will be seen played for perhaps the future ten years or more.

## Research Questions : 
Does important historical events induce the creation of corresponding stereotypical characters in their contemporary movies ?

Does a time-lapse exist between the event and its representation in the movie database ?

Can we predict the stereotypical characters of an era given its historical context ?

What types of events were the most influential of the stereotypical character representation over the

twentieth century (ex : wars, social revolutions,
natural catastrophes) ? 

Are era having a similar historical context presenting the same stereotypical characters ?
