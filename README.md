# The metamorphosis of Movie Archetypes: A timeless tale of film personas

## Abstract
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This research investigates how historical events influence the creation and evolution of character archetypes in films. While it's well-known that films reflect societal changes through themes, we explore whether this also extends to the characters portrayed. Our hypothesis posits that major historical events, such as wars and revolutions, give rise to stereotypical character archetypes, like soldiers or activists. We aim to develop methods for extracting character data from film datasets and analyze how these archetypes change over time. This study will deepen our understanding of how cinema mirrors societal transformations.

## Research Questions : 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1. **How do major historical events influence the creation of stereotypical characters in films?**
  Specifically, how do major historical events (e.g., wars, social revolutions, economic crises) lead to the emergence of recurring character traits or archetypes? For instance, do global conflicts like World War II result in an increase in soldier archetypes? Stereotypical characters will be defined based on recurring descriptors (e.g., soldier, activist, hero) present in plot summaries.

2. **What is the temporal gap between significant historical events and the appearance of related character archetypes in films?**
  How long after an event do these characters begin to appear, and when do they peak in frequency? For example, do soldier characters emerge immediately after World War II or years later?
Trend measurements will be quantified by tracking the frequency of character archetypes and associated descriptors (e.g., soldier, veteran) over decades and comparing their appearance relative to historical events.

3. **Which types of historical events have the most significant influence on the emergence of stereotypical character archetypes?**
Do wars, social revolutions, economic crises, or natural disasters produce the most pronounced shifts in character representation? What types of characters (e.g., soldiers, rebels, entrepreneurs) are most strongly associated with different types of events? We will categorize events into types (e.g., wars, revolutions, economic downturns) and measure the association between each type and the emergence of specific character traits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
4. **How do historical contexts with similar characteristics result in the emergence of comparable character archetypes across different eras?**
Do similar social or political climates (e.g., periods of war or economic hardship) lead to the creation of similar character types across different decades? For example, do both the World Wars and the Cold War produce characters like soldiers, spies, or heroes? We will use clustering or semantic similarity techniques to identify common character traits across different eras and compare how similar historical contexts influence character creation. 
</p>

## Additional datasets
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To link historical events with their cinematic representations, we compiled a timeline of key historical events using datasets from Wikipedia and Wikidata. Given the complexity of analyzing extensive datasets, we focus on significant events, such as world wars, the Cold War, and the Great Depression. This allows us to examine their direct impact on character portrayal in films, ensuring clarity and objectivity in the analysis.

## Methods : 

### Character related information extraction : 

We tested different techniques to extracte characters description from the text: 
1. NLTK combined with LDA
2. BERT (Named Entity Recognition) combined with Spacy

### Information analysis

Our analysis proceeds by splitting the dataset into decades to match the historical context of each period. We focus on identifying recurring names and adjectives associated with characters, which will allow us to:
1. Plot character trends: Visualizing the most common character names and adjectives for each decade using bar plots and word clouds.
2. Examine term associations: Plotting the distribution of terms associated with specific historical events (e.g., "war" may correlate with "soldier" or "captain").
3. Conduct statistical tests: Comparing the frequency of character names and traits across different decades and historical contexts to identify correlations between historical events and character types.
4. Clustering analysis: Grouping films by decade or historical context based on character-related terms to explore patterns and similarities between eras with similar events.
