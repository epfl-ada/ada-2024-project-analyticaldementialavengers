## The metamorphosis of Movie Archetypes: A timeless tale of film personas

A given historical context has a high influence on the topics approached in its contemporary movies. Typically, the Japanese animes were a catharsis of the traumas caused by the Second World War to the Japanese population. In this research, we want to test if it is true for the characters portrayed in the movies as well. Has each era a stereotypical character derived from time corresponding historical events (i.e. : are more soldiers characters presented after war events or more astronauts during the space exploration period) ? We aim to create a time journey in which we will meet those time stereotypes and, maybe, given our own historical context, be able to predict what is the incoming character movie star that will be seen played for perhaps the future ten years or more.
