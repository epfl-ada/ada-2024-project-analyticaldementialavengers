Cocoon: The Return
Cocoon: The Return  is a 1988 American science
fiction  comedy-drama  film directed by Daniel Petrie
and written by Stephen McPherson . The film serves as
the sequel  to the 1985 film Cocoon . All of the starring
actors from the first film reprised their roles in this
film, although Brian Dennehy  only appears in one
scene at the end of the film. Unlike its predecessor , the
film was neither a commercial nor a critical success.
Five years after they left Earth following a failed
rescue mission, the Antareans return to rescue the
cocoons that were left behind. Before they can be
retrieved, one of the cocoons is discovered by a
science research team and taken to a secure laboratory
for testing. The alien s and their human allies must find
a way to retrieve  the cocoon in time for their
rendezvous with the rescue ship, while the humans
traveling with them must decide whether to return to
Antarea or stay on Earth and become mortal again.
Joe learns that his leukemia  has returned, but he knows
it will be cured again as soon as he and Alma leave
Earth. When Alma is hit by a car while saving a child,
Joe gives up the last of his life force, saving her life but
sacrificing his. Before dying, he tells Alma to accept a
job offer at a presch ool and that he loves her. Art and
Bess learn  that Bess is pregnant, and decide to raise the
child on Antarea so they will live long enough to see
him grow up. Ben and Mary reconnect with their
family and friends, including Bernie who is shown to
have found love with Ruby , alleviating his suicidal
depression over Rose's death. Although a lovelorn Jack
once again attempts to woo Kitty , she instead grants
him a vision of his future, showing him children and a
wife with a small heart-shaped birthmark on her neck.PlotEdited by Mark Warner

on Earth to work at the preschool. Art, Kitty , Ben, and
his grands on David (Barret Oliver) then rescue the
Antarean from the Oceanographic Institute. Sara, one
of the scientists working at the institute, becomes
aware of the compan y's plans to hand the alien over to
the military . Unhappy about this, she allows them to
escape when she discovers the rescuers.
After the four get the Antarean on Jack's boat out at
sea, Ben makes it known to everyone that he and Mary
are staying on Earth as well, since family is more
important than living forever and that they should not
outlive their children. When the spaceship arrives, they are met by Walter before the Antareans, Art, Bess,
and the cocoons left behind from the previous trip are brought aboard the space ship which departs for
their homeworld.
Back at the port after he has said his goodbyes to Ben, Mary , and David, Jack is approached by Sara
asking if he knows a place where she could get some gas. They walk and talk for a bit, and Sara tells him
she just quit her job. He eventually notices the small heart-shaped birthmark on her neck.

and a half out of four stars: "Yes, the performances are wonderful, and, yes, it's great to see these
