The Rise of the Johnsons
The Rise of the Johnsons  is a lost 1914 American
silent comedy film produced by the Lubin
Manufacturing Company , featuring John Edwards ,
Mattie Edwards , and Oliver Hardy .[1][2]
Steve Johnson and his wife are down  on their luck.
Steve borrows some money from the grocery man, but
rather than buying groceries, he is persuaded to join a
game of craps on the upper floor of a nearby house.
When the game attracts the attention of the police, the
gamblers try to escape by sliding down a chute from an
upstairs window , only to find that the cops have parked
a paddy wagon at the bottom of the chute. While the others slide down into the wagon, Steve gathers up
the money and escap es by another window . The next day he pays off his bills and returns home to a lavish
banquet, accompanied by two new servants.[3][2]

The Rise of the Johnsons  was filmed in Jacksonville, Florida , at the Jacksonville unit of the Lubin
Manufacturing Company , under the general supervision of Arthur Hotaling .[2] It was a short split-reel
comedy , lasting approximately 6–7 minutes, and sharing a single reel of film with a second, unrelated
comedy , She Gave Him a Rose , starring Raymond McKee , Frances Ne Moyer , and William Rice.[1] The
films were released by the General Film Company on August 1, 1914.[2]
The Rise of the Johnsons  was one of a series of "Colored Comedies" produced by the Lubin studio
between 1913 and 1915, starring vetera n vaudeville and minstrel show perform ers John (Junk) Edwards
and Mattie  Edwards .[4] Apart from the two stars, most of the casts of these films were untrained Black
extras from the Jacksonville community ,[5] but a few parts were played by white members of the Florida
stock company , including, in this case, the young Oliver Hardy , who had a small role as a grocery man.[2]Plot
Cast
Production and r eceptionReviews of the film in the trade papers were positive, although sometimes condescending and
emphasizing the film's appeal as a glimpse of stereotypical African American life. Motion Pictur e News
praised the Edwards  as "those inimitable darkey comedians";[6] and The Biosc ope described  the comedy
as "a briskly played tale of the American 'darkey' life, ... a welcome novelty  and sufficiently good to
create many laughs at the antics of the artists. Much talent is displayed in the acting, and although the
acquisition of Massa Johnson's wealth may be seen as a somewhat doubt ful proceeding, a highly
humorous burlesque is the result."[7] Moving Pictur e World wrote "John and Mattie Edwards and Babe
Hardy have the leading roles and make of this a laughable and entertaining comedy . The incidents which
occur in the various scenes kept the audience laughing heartily ."[8]
