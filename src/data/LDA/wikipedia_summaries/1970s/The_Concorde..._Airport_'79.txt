The Concorde... Airport '79
The Concorde... Airport '79 is a 1979 American air
disaster film (in the UK, it was released a year later as
Airport '80: The Concorde ) and the fourth and final
installment of the Airport  franchise. Although  critically
panned and earning poorly in North America, the film
was a commercial success internationally , grossing a
total of $65 million on a $14 million budget.
The film was directed by David Lowell Rich .[2] The
all-star  cast includes Geor ge Kennedy , who appeared
in all four films from the Airport  series, and starring
Alain Delon , Susan Blakely  and Robert Wagner  in the
main roles . Mercedes McCambr idge and Martha Raye
have supporting roles.
Kevin Harrison, a corrupt arms dealer , attempts to
destroy an America n-owned Concorde  on its maiden
flight after one of the passengers, reporter Maggie
Whelan, learns of his weapons sales to communist
countries  during the Cold War.
The Concorde takes off from Charles de Gaulle Airport
in Paris  and lands at Dulles Airport  outside
Washington, D.C. , despite being forced to perform a go
around  when environmental protestors deliberately fly
a hot air balloon  into its approach path.
Maggie reports on the flight the following day, which
leads to a story of Harrison and his Buzzard surface-to-
air missile  project. A man named Carl Parker shows up
to Maggie with a claim about documentation of illegal
arms deals, but is shot by an assaila nt who chases
Maggie throughout the house before a passerby
triggers a fire alarm, scaring the assailant away .
Maggie is told by Harrison someone is framing him.
He sends Maggie off in a limo, then plots to destroy
the Concorde with Maggie on it by reprogramming an
attack drone test with the Concorde as the new tar get.PlotCinematography Philip H. Lathrop

Box office $65 millionCapt. Joe Patroni and Capt. Paul Metrand board the
Concorde, where they are joined by Peter O'Neill, the
2nd of ficer and flight engineer .
Harrison surprises Maggie at the airline check-in desk
to see her off. He asks whether the documents have
shown up, but they have not. As he is walking away ,
Parker's wife delivers the documents to Maggie as she
steps into the mobil e lounge. She looks them over and
realizes that Harrison has lied to her .
The Concorde takes off for Paris. Unbeknownst to the
flight crew , an off-course surface-to-air missi le is
headed straight for them. At his company headquarters,
Harrison tells his controllers to alert the government.
The USAF  scrambles F-15  fighter jets to intercept the
missile as it locks onto the Concorde. After several
evasive maneuvers by the passenger plane, an F-15
shoots down the missile.
As the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an F-4 Phantom II sent by Harrison engages the
Concorde as French Air Force  Mirage F1s scramble to help. The Concorde evades the F-4's missiles, but
the explosion of one of them damages the plane's hydraulics. The Mirages shoo t down the F-4 before the
Concorde reaches the French coastline to continue towards Paris. Due to hydraulic system damage, the
plane lands at Le Bourget Airport  inste ad of Charles de Gaulle. The Concorde barely stops at the last
safety net. Metrand and Isabelle invite Patroni to dinner .
Harrison promises Maggie to go public with the documents but attempts to bribe her into "polishing" his
statement. After being paid by Harrison, a mechanic, Froelich, places a device in the Concorde's cargo
door control unit, timed to open during flight.
As the passengers board, Froelich is in line at the security checkpoint when some of his money falls out
of his trouser leg. The X-ray technician attempts to return it, but Froelich pretends not to hear and runs
off. On the runway , where the Concorde is taking off, the aircraft's exhaust renders Froelich unconscious
and scatters the money he received from Harrison.
En route to Moscow , the automatic device opens the cargo door. Metrand sees the carpet tear down the
middle of the aisle, signifying the fusel age is under tremendous stress and the aircraft is about to break
apart. The cargo door is ripped off, causing a sudden decompression , damaging the aircraft and ripping a
segment of the floor , knocking out the primary flight controls as it spirals towards the ground. The airline
founder's seat lodges in the hole, acting as a plug. With only back-up systems available, the pilots attempt
to fly to Innsbruck , Austria, for an emer gency landing, but they are losing too much fuel and do not have
enough to make it there. Metrand realizes they are flying towards a ski area he knows along the Alps  in
Patscherkofel ; they could make a belly landing on a mountain-side.
The aircra ft approaches the landing site while the ski patrol marks a runway , landing successfully . While
passengers are being rescued, Maggie reports on the accident to a news reporter and mentions a major
story she is about to release. Harrison, en route back to Washington, sees the newscast in his private planeand commits suicide. The last of the crew leaves the Concorde shortly before the fuselage explodes from
leaking fuel.

It took producer Jennings Lang a number of years to get permission from Air France  to use the Concorde.
Air France requested some changes to the story and dialogue.[3] Lang argued the film was not a direct
sequel because it used different characters and settings, apart from Geor ge Kennedy whose character was
promoted to pilot.[4] The plot to bring down the Concorde in the second act of the film was very similar
to the Turkish Airlines Flight 981 accident six years earlier , in that an explosive decompression (and
subsequent loss of control) was caused by the cargo hold door blowing off in flight, although it is not
known if this was coincidence, or indeed the writers' direct inspiration.Cast
ProductionThe film was origin ally going to be called Airport '79 - the Concor de but Lang decided to rename it so it
would not be confu sed with Airport 75 and Airport 77.[5] In October 1978 Universal announced  that
filming would start in November .[6] Susan Blakely  appeared in the film as the first in a three-picture deal
she signed with Universal following the success of Rich Man, Poor Man.[7] Parts of the film were also
shot in Alta, Utah .[8] Filming had finished by February 1979.[9]
Sylvia Kristel wrote in her memoi rs that Delon was unhappy with the size of his trailer and insisted he be
given Rich 's trailer , which was larger. Rich complained to Lang, who supported  Delon.[10] Kristel wrote
that towards the end the shoot, the director started "being overtly misogyni stic. He treats me badly ,
shouting, making me repeat things all the time for no reason."[11]
The film was the recipient of mostly negative reviews by critics upon its release , and years later holds an
approval rating of 25% on the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  based on eight reviews.[12]
Vincent Canby  of The New York Times wrote, "The Concor de – Airport '79 is – how should I put it? – not
the best of the series, but to say that it's the worst is to convey the wrong impression. In this case, worst is
best."[13] Variety ′s review called the film "Definitely not for sophisticates, Concor de is a throw back to the
old popcorn genre, and rather enjoyab le at that" but noted that "unintentional comedy still seems the
Airport  series' forte".[14] Stu Goldstein BoxOffice  graded the film as "Poor" and called it "so silly it's
actually entertaining."[15] David Ansen  of Newsweek  wrote, "You have to respect a movie so single-
mindedly dedicated to High Silliness. The advantage of its blithe disregard for plausibility is a plot that
zips along at such breakneck pace that the audience is too busy counting the holes in the Concorde to
question the holes in the plot."[16] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune  gave the film one star out of four
and called the story "ludicrous."[17] Sheila Benson  of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "The disaster they
face is as contrived as the characters. You never believe for a second that these passengers are in any
danger , beyond getting airsick or mussing their hair."[18] Gary  Arnold of The Washington Post calle d the
film "nearly as funny as The Big Bus , albeit unwittingly ."[19]
Film critic Roger Ebert  highlighted the film in his book I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie , deriding the
science in the scene where Patroni fires a flare gun out of the cockpit window .[20]
It is also listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide
as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.[21]Reception
Critical reception
Box officeProduced on a budget of $14 million, it earned a little over $13 million in the United States and
Canada,[22] thus ending the enormous financial success of the Airport  films. International ly the film still
performed well, grossing $52 million for a worldwide total of $65 million.[23]
The Concorde aircraft used in the film first flew on January 31, 1975, and was registered as F-WTSC to
the Aérospatiale  aircraft company . It would be re-registered by Aérospatiale as F-BTSC and leased to Air
France in 1976. In 1989, this Concorde carried Pope John Paul II .[24]
On July 25, 2000, F-BTSC, as Air France  Flight 4590 , was hit by runway debris on takeof f, igniting the
leaking fuel on the wing's fuel tank (part of the fuselage), and causing the aircraft to crash in the small
French town of Gonesse, killing all 109 passengers and crew on board, as well as four on the ground. At
the time of the accident, F-BTSC had logged 1 1,989 hours and 4,873 cycles.[25]
For the film's May 1982 network television premiere on ABC , additional footage was added to expand
the film's running time so it could be shown in a three-hour time slot.[26]
