Black Christmas (1974 film)
Black Christmas[i] is a 1974 Canadian slasher film
produced and directed by Bob Clark , and written by
Roy Moore. It stars Olivia Hussey , Keir Dullea ,
Margot Kidder , and John Saxon . The story follows a
group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone
calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a
killer during the Christmas  season.
Inspired by the urban legend "the babysitter and the
man upsta irs" and a series of murders that took place  in
the Westmount neighbo urhood  of Montreal , Quebec ,
Moore wrote the screenplay under the title Stop Me.
The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the
script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with
young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto  in 1974
on an estimated budget of $686,0 00, and was
distributed by Warner Bros. in North America,
eventually grossing $4,053,000 worldwide.[3]
Upon its release, Black Christmas  received mixed
reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal,
with film historians noting it for being one of the
earliest slasher films.[4] It is also praised for its
influence on John Carp enter 's Halloween  (1978). Aside
from it earning a cult following[5] since its release, a
novelization written by Lee Hays was published in
1976. It is the first film in the Black Christmas  series,
being followed by two remakes in 2006  and 2019 .
An unseen man climbs the exterior of a sorority house ,
where a Christmas party is being held, and enters the
attic. The house phone then rings. Sorority sister Jess
Bradford  answers to discover it is an obscene phone
call from a person who has called before, whom the
sorority has nicknamed "The Moaner ." Jess and the
other sorority members listen as the caller rants and
screams in strange voices, before abruptly threatening
to kill them. Upset by the call, a younger studentPlotRelease dates October 11, 1974

upstairs to her bedroom to pack her suitcase. There,
unbeknownst to the rest of the sorority , Clare is
attacked and asphyxiated by the intruder .
The follow ing morn ing, Clare's father arrives, saying
that she failed to meet him at a train station.
Housemother  Mrs. MacHenry offers to help Mr.
Harrison look for her. Later that day, Jess informs her
boyfriend, Peter , that she is pregnant and plans to
under go an abortion , much to his disapproval.
Meanwhile, Harriso n and two other sorority members,
Barb and Phyl, attem pt to report Clare's  disappearance
to Sergean t Nash. Nash does not take them seriously until Chris Hayden, Clare's boyfriend, barges in
angrily later in the day and demands something be done about it.
A search party is held that night for Clare, in which Harrison, Chris and most of the sorority gets
involved. Meanwhil e, Mrs. MacHenry discovers Clare's body in the attic before the killer murders her
with a crane hook. Shortly after, Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with
the police. Lieutenant Fuller arrives with a telephone lineman to tap the phone , so that the police can
determine the identity of the caller .
After Fuller leaves, a group of Christmas carolers  appe ar at the front door. As Jess watches the singers,
the killer sneaks into Barb's room and stabs her to death with a glass unicorn figurine, with her cries for
help being  drowned out by the carolers. Jess then receives another obscene phon e call, in which the caller
emulates parts of her argument with Peter. Fuller calls her to say the attempt to trace the call failed, and
they both begin placing suspicions towa rds Peter . Jess and Phyl decide to lock every door and window in
the house. Shortly after , however , Phyl is murdered by the killer after finding Barb's body .
Jess receives yet another obscene phone call, which is successfully traced by the police. Nash instructs
Jess to leave the house immediately , as the calls are coming from inside. Jess goes to alert Barb and Phyl,
only to discover them dead. Jess sees the killer's eye staring at her through a door crack, before she slams
the door against him and flees. The killer chases after her, and (unable to open  the front door) Jess runs
into the basement, locking it behind her. Shortly after, though, Peter breaks through the basement window
and slowly approaches Jess as he worr iedly asks if she is okay . In a state of panic, Jess beats Peter to
death with a fire poker and police find her barely conscious as she cradles Peter's body .
Believing that Peter was the killer , the police put Jess to bed and leave her sleep ing alone in her bedroom,
with a police officer standing outside the house. Shortly after, the killer's voice is heard from the attic,
where Clare and Mrs. Mac's corpses remain undiscovered. The attic hatch opens before the house's
telephone begins to ring.

Black Christmas  was initially develo ped by Canadian screenwriter Roy Moore, who wrote the screenplay
under the title Stop Me.[10] Inspi rations for the film came from the urban legend  known as "the babysitter
and the man upstairs ",[11] which had become widespread during the 1970s.[12][13] Moore claimed to have
been inspi red by a series of murders that occurred during the holiday season in the Westmount  area of
Montreal .[14][15]
As noted in an article for The Telegraph , the murd ers, whic h occurred in 1943,  were perpetrated by a
fourteen-year -old boy who bludgeoned several of his family members to death.[7] Film producers Harvey
Sherman and Richard Schouten had Timothy Bond  rewrite the script to give it a university setting.[11][16]
Director and producer Bob Clark , who had felt the original script was too much of a straightforward
slasher film, made several alterations in dialogue,[11] and also incorporated humorous elements into the
film, particularly the drunkenness of Barb, and Mrs. Mac, the latter of whom Clark based on his aunt.[10]
Clark felt that colle ge and high school students had not been depicted with "any sense of reality" in
American film, and that he intended to capture the "astuteness" of young adults: "College students —
even in 1974 — are astute people. They're not fools. It's not all 'bikinis, beach blankets, [and] bingo'".[10]
Olivia Hussey , who had previously garnered international fame for her role as Juliet  in Romeo and Juliet
(1968), signed on to appear in the film after being told by a psychic  that she would "make a film in
Canada that would earn a great deal of money".[10] Clark sought Keir Dullea  to play the role of Peter
based on his performance as Dave Bow man in 2001: A Space Odyssey  (1968).[10] The role of Mrs. Mac
was offered to Bette Davis ,[11] who decli ned the part.[10] Margot Kidder  was cast in the role of Barb, andProduction
Development
CastingThe central cast of Black
Christmas (clockwise from left
to right): Olivia Hussey, Keir
Dullea, John Saxon, and
Margot Kidder.
Soldiers' Tower at the University of
Toronto is featured in the film.said she had been attracted to the character "because she was wild and out
of control", and not a "conventional leading" part.[10] For the role of Clare
Harrison, whose murder jump-starts the film's plot, Toronto native Lynne
Griffin was cast after her mother , who was also her casting agent at the
time, got her an audition. Griffin would later go on to star in Curtains
(1983), and in the acclaimed television series Wind at My Back  (1996–
2001).[17]
Gilda Radner was offered the role of Phyllis Carlson. She accepted the
part, but dropped out one month before filming began owing to Satur day
Night Live commitm ents, and was replaced by fellow Second City comedy
troupe performer Andrea Martin .[11][10] The role of Lieuten ant Fuller was
originally given to Edmond O'Brien . Upon his arrival to the set, however ,
the producers realized he would be unable to fulfill the duties required of
the part due to his failing health (stemming from Alzheimer's disease ).[8]
John Saxo n, who had read the script prior , was called by the producers
who offered him the role. He accepted, and had to arrive in Toronto from
New York City within two days to begin shooting.[10] Saxon had
previously appeared in the first giallo  film, The Girl Who Knew Too Much  (1963).[18] Clark always
intended to cast Saxon from the beginning as he was his first choice for the role, but miscommunications
between Clark and Saxon’ s agent resulted in O’Brien being cast before Saxon officially came aboard the
film. For the role of the film's antagon ist, Italian-Canadian actor Nick Mancuso was cast as one of the
main voice s in the phone call sequences. When auditioning  for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in
a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face. Clark then had Mancuso experiment with
different voices in order to come up with one that was right for the character , with Clark later offering
him the part.[7]
The film was shot from 25 March to 11 May 1974, at a cost of
$686,000 (equivalent to $4,113,382 in 2023), with $200,000
coming from the Canadian Film Development Corporation .[19]
The house featured in the film had been discovered by Clark while
scouting for locations, and its owners agreed to lease the home for
the production.[10] Additional photography was completed  on the
University of Toronto  campus.[10] According to John Saxon, Clark
had meticulously drawn out storyboards  with key shots, which he
brought to the film set each day: "I could understand exactly what
I thought he needed, and the scene need ed".[10] Scen es in the film
involving POV  shot of Billy scaling the house was accomplished
through the use of a rig designed by camera operator  Bert Dunk , which was attached to Dunk 's head as he
climbed up the side of the house.[9] Griffin's death scene, which was shot with a handheld camera in a
real closet, was accomplished in only a couple of takes. According to Griffin, her character's surprise as
the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: "It was a total shock because I
didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required
the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would alsoFilmingstate that these scenes came relatively easy for her: "I was actually , and still am, a fairly good swimmer so
I could hold my breath for a long time. And I could also keep my eyes open for a long time without
blinking".[17]
Kidder remembered shooting the film as being "fun. I really bonded with Andrea Martin, filming in
Toronto and Ontario. Olivia Hussey was a bit of an odd one. She was obsessed with the idea of falling in
love with Paul McCartney  through her psychic. We were a little hard on her for things like that".[20]
The comp oser of the film's score, Carl Zittrer , stated in an interview that he created the film's mysterious
music by tying forks, combs, and knives onto the strings of the piano  to warp the sound of the keys.[8]
Zittrer also stated that he would distort  the sound further by recording its sound onto an audiotape and
make the sound slower .[8] The audio for the disturbing phone calls was performed by multiple actors
including Mancuso[11][7] and direc tor Bob Clark.[8] Mancuso stated in an interview that he stood on his
head during the recording sessions to compress his thorax  and make his voice sound more demen ted.[6]
Mancuso spent only three days record ing dialogue for the character , later recalling the experience as
being very " avant-garde ", with Clark encouraging him to improvise with the character's voice.[7]
During preparation in 1975 for the film's American release, Warner Bros.  studi o executives asked Clark to
change the concluding scene to show Clare's boyfriend, Chris, appear in front of Jess and say, "Agnes,
don't tell them what we did" before killing her. However , Clark insisted  on keeping the ending
ambiguous. The original title of the film was initially planned to be Stop Me.[11] Clark has stated in an
interview that he came up with the film's official title, saying that he enjoyed the irony of a dark event
occurring during a festive holiday . According to Clark as well, Warner Bros. changed the title to Silent
Night, Evil Night  for the United States theatrical release.[8]
Black Christmas  was distributed in Canada by Ambassador Film Distributors and released in Toronto on
11 October 1974.[21][19] The film grossed $143,000 from nine theatres in Toronto in its first two weeks
and earned $1.3 million during its theatrical run in Canada. Warner Bros. believed that the film would
earn at least $7 million in the United States. The film was released on 20 December , but only earned
$284,345 during its theatrical run due to competition from The Godfather Part II and The Man with the
Golden Gun.[22] For its American release the film was retitled to Silent Night, Evil Night due to fears that
the origin al title would mislead audien ces into believing the film was a blaxploitation  movie. They
retracted the title after the initial release, restoring it to Black Christmas  for subsequent screenings.[10]
Warner Bros. rereleased the film in Los Angeles in August 1975, and it earned  $86,340 in one week. Its
theatrical run was extended to nineteen  theatres. The film's successful run in Los Angeles and Chicago
resulted in Warner Bros. expanding the film to seventy theatres for Halloween. However , the film only
made $354,990 from those theatres, worth $700 per theatre per day, causing fifty-eight of the locations to
cancel their bookings. The film ended its theatrical run in December after making less than $1 million
that year .[23]Post-production
Release
TheatricalThe film was the third-highest-grossing Canadian film of all time in Canada with a gross of $2 million,
behind The Appr enticeship of Duddy Kravitz  (1974) and the French language Deux femmes en or (1970),
directed by Claude Fournier .[24][25]
To comme morate the film’ s 50th Anniversary , a theatrical re-release for the film was held from December
7-22 in select cinem as across the United  States, in a restored 4K format for the first time from the original
camera negative.[26][27][28]
The film, under the title Stranger in the House , was set to make its network televisio n premiere on
Saturday night, January 28, 1978, on NBC 's weekly "Saturday Night at the Movies". Two weeks prior to
its premiere, the Chi Omega  sorority house on the campus of Florida State University  in Tallahassee  was
the scene of a double murder in which two Chi Omega sisters, asleep in their beds, were bludgeoned to
death. The killer then went to a nearby room in the sorority house and violently attacked two more
sleeping students, who survived. The killer was later identified as Ted Bundy , who was executed for this
and other homicides on January 24, 1989.[29]
A few days before the film was set to premiere on network television Florida's then-Governor Reubin
Askew  contacted NBC President Robert Mullholland to request the movie not be shown due to its all-too-
similar theme as the murders of sorority sisters by an unknown madman at the Chi Omega Sorority
House. On Tuesday , January 24, NBC-TV  gave several of its affiliates in Florida, Geor gia, and Alabama,
the option  of showing an alternate film, Doc Savag e: The Man of Bronze, in place of Stranger in the
House .[29]
The report revealed that "the network said in a statement issued yesterday in New York City that it was
responding to concern voiced by the affiliates because of the murder of two coed s this month in a sorority
house at Florida State University in Tallahassee".[29]
Black Christmas  has been released on DVD  several times in North America. A 25th-anniversary edition
was releas ed in Canada on November 6, 2001, by Critical Mass.[30] This edition only contains the
theatrical trailer as a bonus feature.[31] The following year, on December 3, 2002, Critical Mass released a
Collector's Edition of the film on DVD  with making-of documentaries, two audio commentary tracks,
and reversible English and French cover artwork.[32]
On December 5, 2006, Critical Mass released a third "Special Edition" DVD with a newly remastered
transfer , two original scenes with newly-uncovered vocal tracks, a new documentary on the making of the
film, and cast and crew interviews.[33] This edition was later released on Blu-ray  on November 11,
2008.[34]
Anchor Bay Entertainment  released a Blu-ray and DVD in Canada, titled the "Season's Grievings
Edition". It contains the same transfer of the film as the "Special Edition" release and all previous bonus
content, plus the addition of a new documentary ("Black Christmas Legacy"),  a 40th-anniversary panel
from Fan Expo  2014, a new commentary track featuring Nick Mancuso as the character "Billy", a newTelevision broadcast
Home mediaretrospective booklet written by Rue Morgue Magazine , and new packaging art by Gary Pullin (art
director  of Rue Morgue Magazine). This new edition was released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 24,
2015.[35]
In the United States, Scream Factory  released the film in a collector's edition Blu-ray on December 13,
2016, with a new transfer and new extras.[36] The Scream Factory release collates all of the bonus
materials from the previous releases by Critical Mass and Anchor Bay, and also features the 2006 Critical
Mass restoration of the film in the bonus materials.[36] Scream Factory also released the film in a
collector's edition 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray on December 6, 2022.[37] Unlike the previous home media
releases and like the 1986 U.S. VHS  release from Warner Home Video, the collector's edition 4K Ultra
HD + Blu-ray release (Disc 1 and 2) featured the Warner Bros. logo at the beginning and end of the film.
During its initial release, the film garnered mixed reviews. A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it
"a whodunit that raises the question as to why was it made".[38] Variety  called the film "a bloody ,
senseless kill-for -kicks feature, [that] exploits unnecessary violence in a university sorority house
operated by an implausibly alcoholic ex-hoofer . Its slow-paced, murky tale involves an obscene telephone
caller who apparently delights in killing the girls off one by one, even the hapless house-mother".[39]
Gene Siskel  of the Chicago Tribune  gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it a "routine shocker" that
"is notable  only for indicating the kind of junk roles that talented actresses are forced to play in the
movies".[40] Kevin Thomas  of the Los Angeles Times wrote: "Before it maddeningly overrea ches in a
gratuitously evasive ending, Black Christmas  (opening today at selected theaters) is a smart, stylish
Canadian-made little horror picture that is completely diverting ... It may well be that its makers simply
couldn't figure out how to end it".[41]
Later reviews have been more positive. On Rotten Tomatoes , Black Christmas  holds an approval rating of
70% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "The
rare slasher with enough intelligence to wind up the tension between bloody outbursts, Black Christmas
offers fiendishly enjoyable holiday view ing for genre fans".[42] On Metacritic  the film has a weighted
average score of 65 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[43]
Heidi Martinuzzi of Film Threat called the film "innovative" and praised the leading actresses, Olivia
Hussey and Margot Kidder .[44] TV Guide  awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: "Although
strictly standard fare, the material is elevated somewhat through Clark's skillful handling of such plot
devices as obscene phone calls from the killer to the girls via the upstairs phone and a nicely handled
twist ending, which provides a genuine shock".[45] Author and film critic Leonard Maltin  gave the film
two and a half out of four stars calling it "bizarre" but also praised Kidder's perfo rmance as a standout.[46]
The Time Out  film guide noted that the film "manages a good slice of old-fashioned suspense".[47]

Black Christmas  eventually gained a cult following , and is notable for being one of the earliest slasher
films . It went on to inspire other slasher films, the biggest one of all being John Carp enter 's Halloween
(which was appare ntly inspired by Clark suggesting what a Black Christmas  sequel would be
like).[53][10][54]
Black Christmas  has been included in multiple lists in various media outlets as one of the greatest horror
films ever made. The film ranked No. 87 on Bravo 's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments .[55] It was ranked
at No. 67 in IndieW ire's The 100 Best Horr or Movies of All Time, its entry stating that "the plot sounds
formulaic, but Black Christmas  remains timeless thanks to its terrifying  and elusive killer , 'Billy', whose
backstory is never revealed, as well as a foreboding ending that doesn't offer much hope for the film's
Final Girl" .[56] Thrillist 's Scott Weinber g, in his article The 75 Best Horr or Movies of All Time, ranked the
film at No. 48.[57] Paul Schrodt of Esquir e placed the film at No. 23 in his list of the 50 Best Horror
Films of All Time.[58] In 2017, Complex  magazine named Black Christmas  the 2nd-best slasher film of all
time.[59] The following year, Paste  listed it the 3rd-best slasher film of all time,[60] while also placing the
character Jess Bradford at #1 in their list of "20 Best 'Final Girls' in Horror Movie History".[61] While
director Clark maintained he did not intend for the film to have political leanings , critics have noted Black
Christmas  is noneth eless a feminist  film for its treatme nt of female charact ers—particularly Jess having
agency and making the choice to have an abortion—and its portrayal of casual misogyny (as when the
police initially fail to take the sorority's concerns about the phone calls and Clare's absence
seriously).[62][63][64] Film critic Tim Dirks of the film-revie w website Filmsite.or g added the film to his
list of films featuring the "Greatest Film Plot Twists, Film Spoilers and Surprise Endings", based on the
film's major plot twists  – the revelation that the real killer was hidden inside the unsearched attic, and
Jess' implied murder .[65]
Hussey told Bravo  during an interview about their 100 Scariest Movie Moments  series, that when she met
Steve Martin  for the first time, he told her that she starred in one of his favorite films of all time. Hussey
initially thought he was referring to Romeo and Juliet , but was surprised when Martin said it was Black
Christmas  and that he had seen the film 27 times.[66]Legacy

NovelizationA novelization  of the film written by Lee Hays was published in 1976 by Popular Library .[67][68] The
book follows roughly the same plot, but sticks with Roy Moore's original script. Because of this, the
novel ends up fleshing out the character s more, adding scenes and lines of dialo gue that were initially cut
from the film's final script, and giving the Pi Kappa Sigma property more backstory .[69]
Black Christmas  has been remade on two separate occasions, with the films differing significantly from
the original.
The first remake  was writt en and directed by Glen Morgan and was released on December 25, 2006, by
Dimension Films  and MGM Distribution Co.. It is loosely based  on the original film, containing more
graphic content and a focus into the past of Billy . Andrea Martin was the only original cast member to
appear in the film, and Clark served as an executive producer .[70]
The second remake  was directed and co-written by Sophia Takal.[71][72][73] Starring Imogen Poots  and
Cary Elwes , the film was released on December 13, 2019, by Universal Pictures .[74]
A short fan film funded through an Indiegogo  campaign was released on YouTube and Vimeo with the
title It's Me, Billy , in May 2021. It is billed as an "unof ficial sequel" to the original film and picks up the
story 50 years later, following the grand daughter of Jess Bradford. The film was written, produced, and
directed by Dave McRae and Bruce Dale and acts as a concept for a feature film as well as the first part
of a two-p art story . The film is available  for free. It's Me, Billy  was nomi nated for Best Cinematograph y
in the Dramatic Short category at the 65th annual CSC (Canadian Society of Cinematographers)
awards.[75][76][77]
On May 1, 2023, it was announced that It's Me, Billy Chapt er 2 had begun crowdfu nding on Indiegogo
and that original film stars Olivia Hussey and Lynne Griffin would be joining the cast. The film is
expected to be relea sed online for free in 2024.[78] On November 4, 2023 it was announced that Hussey
had pulled out of the project for health reasons. On November 6 it was announced that the role of Jess
Bradford had been recast with Canadian  actress Lisa Kovack. A teaser trailer for It's Me, Billy Chapte r 2
was releas ed on December 19, 2023. The film's official trailer was released on August 13, 2024.[79][80]
The film was released on Friday , October 11, 2024 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the
original Black Christmas was first released in Canada.
