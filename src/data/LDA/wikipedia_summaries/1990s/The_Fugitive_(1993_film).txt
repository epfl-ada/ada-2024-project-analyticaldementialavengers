Falsely accused  of murder , he is convicted and
receives a death sentence .
During transport  to death row, Kimble 's fellow
prisoners attempt an escape. In the unrest, the driver
and a prisoner are killed, sending the bus down a
ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble
saves a corrections officer from the collision, and then
flees. Ninety minu tes later, Deputy US Marsh al
Samuel Gerard and his staff arrive at the derailment
scene and launch a manhunt. Kimble sneaks into a
hospital to treat his wounds and acquire clothing. After
altering his appearance, he steals an ambulance and
evades most of the marshals in a tunnel by entering a
storm drain. Gerard follows and loses a gun. Kimble
finds it and proclaims his innocence, pointing the gun
at Gerard, who replies that he does not care. Spare gun in hand, he corners Kimble over a high spillw ay,
but Kimble jumps and escapes.
Seeking to clear his name, he returns to Chicago to search for the real murder er. He rents an apartment
and acquires money from his friend and colleague Dr. Charles Nichols. Posing as a janitor on the night
shift, Kimble infiltrates the prosthetic department at Cook County Hospital  to make a list of patients who
would need an adjustment to a prosthetic arm. At one point, a doctor asks him to transport a young patient
on a gurne y to another floor . While doing so, Kimble looks at the child's X-ray and medical file, and sees
that he has been misdiagnosed. Kimble  changes the young patient's orders, saving his life; however , the
doctor notices this and notifies security , blowing Kimble's cover and causing him to flee the hospital.
Gerard deduces what Kimble is doing and spots him at Chicago City Hall after interviewing a jailed
suspect. Following their subsequent chase, Kimble disappears into Chicago's St. Patrick 's Day parade.
Later , he breaks into the home of another suspect on his list, Fredrick Sykes, and discovers a photo that
shows a connection between Sykes, a former cop, and Sykes' employer , Devlin-MacGregor , a
pharmaceutical company that is releasing a drug called Provasic. Kimble had investigated the drug and
found that it causes liver damage, which  would have prevented FDA  approval. Kimble calls Gerard while
in Sykes' home, ensuring that the call is traced, and then flees, leaving open evidence. With this lead,
Gerard conducts his own investigation, now suspicious of Sykes.
As Kimble  investiga tes samples at his former workplace, Chicago Memorial Hospital , he figures out that
his friend Dr. Nichols, a board mem ber of Devlin-MacGreg or who will profit from sales, covered up
Provasic's side effects to get it approved. Nichols ordered Sykes to murder Kimble in a staged burglary
that went wrong, resulting in Helen's death, and presumably had Sykes murder Dr. Alec Lentz, another
developer who discovered Provasic's risks. En route to a hotel conference where Nichols is presenting
Provasic, Kimble is attacked by Sykes on a train. Sykes murders a transit cop who interrupts their
struggle, but he is then subsequently overpowered by Kimble and handcuf fed to a pole.
Kimble publicly confronts Nichols at the conference, accusing him of falsifying Provasic's side-ef fects
and planni ng the murders. This leads to a fight that spills onto the roof. Chicago Police  issue a shoot-to-
kill order for Kimble since the transit police officer's death is assumed to be his fault, but Gerard stops aAndreas Katsulas portrayed
Fredrick Sykes, also known as the
"one-armed man".police helicopter from sniping Kimble. He calls out to Kimble, informing him of the conspiracy and his
belief in Kimble's innocence. Nichols knocks out Marshal Renfro, takes his gun, and as he readies to
shoot Gerard, Kimble saves him by attacking Nichols with a pipe.
Kimble surrenders, and Sykes and Nich ols are arrested. Kimble is escorted out of the hotel as the press
questions the police about the newfound suspects. Gerard uncuf fs Kimble in the back of a squad car. They
are driven away , and Kimble is assured that he will be exonerated.

Harrison Ford was not originally cast for the role of Dr. Richard Kimble . Instead, a number of actors were
auditioned for the part, including Alec Bald win, Nick Nolte, Kevin Costner, and Michael Douglas . Nick
Nolte in particular felt he was too old for the role (though he is only a year older than Harrison Ford).[4]Cast
Production
CastingAccording to Ford in a 2023 interview with James Hibberd  of The Hollywood Reporter , he pursued the
role of Richard Kimble in part due to his preference for playing characters dissimilar to him, as well as a
desire to grow a beard or moustache for a role, something then Warner Bros.  chairman Robert A. Daly
had repeatedly prevented on the grounds that he was "paying for Harrison Ford's face" and wished to see
it unobstructed by facial hair.[5] Although the role of Sam Gerard went to Tommy Lee Jones , Andrew
Davis considered both Gene Hackman  and Jon Voight  for the role. The character of Dr. Charles Nichols
was recast for Jeroen Krabbé after the original actor who landed the role, Richard Jordan, fell ill with a
brain tumor . Richard Jordan died three weeks after the film's release.[4][6]
Filming began in February 1993 and wrapped in mid-May .[7][8] Film ing locations included Bryson City
and Dillsboro, North Carolina ; Blount County, Tennessee ; and Chic ago.[9] Although almost half of the
film is set in rural Illinois, a large portion of the principal filming was actually shot in Jackson County ,
North Carolina , in the Great Smoky Mountains .
The prison transport bus and freight train wreck scenes were filmed along the Great Smoky Moun tains
Railroad  just outside their depot in Dillsboro; the wreckage can still be seen from the railroad's excursion
trains.[10] The train crash, which cost $1 million to film, was shot in a single take using a real train with a
locomotive whose engine had been removed.[7][4] The wreck took several weeks to plan and was
preceded by several test runs with a boxcar and a log car .[11]
Scenes in the hospital after Richard Kimble initially escapes were filmed at Harris Regional Hospital  in
Sylva, North Carolin a. Cheoah Dam in Deals Gap was the location of the scene in which Kimble jumps
from the dam.
The rest of the film was shot in Chicago, including some of the dam scenes, which were filmed in the
remains of the Chicago freight tunnels. The city hall stair chase (where Kimb le narrowly escapes being
apprehended by Gerard) was filmed in the corridors and lobby of Chicago City Hall. The character Sykes
lived in the historic Pullman  neighborhood of Chicago. Harrison Ford uses the pay phone in the Pullman
Pub, and then climbs a ladder and runs down the roofline of the historic rowhouses.[12] According to
Andrew Davis , it was Ford's idea to film in Chicago. "Originally I wasn't even going to try to come to
Chicago. I thought that the weather would be too cold and difficult for shooting. But Harrison, having
seen several of my prior films shot in Chicago, suggested doing it here." Ford would later explain, "I
grew up in Chicago, went to college in Wisconsin, and came back to take summ er jobs for three years. I
felt this was the best possible option as a location...W e could get the grittiness, we could get the flash of
architecture, the charm of the lake. It has it all."[8]
The chase  scene during the St. Patrick's Day Parade was filmed during the actua l parade held that year on
Wednesday , March 17, 1993, with Mayor Richard M. Daley  and Illinois Attorne y General Roland Burris
briefly seen as actua l participants.[13] Besides The Fugitive , another feature film, Michael Apted 's Blink ,
was filmed during the exact same parade. According to Charles Geocaris, then head of the Chicago Film
Office, both productions approached the film office in February about filming during the parade.
Location managers and production managers for both films worked out the logistics with parade
organizers, but according to Geocaris, the two camera crews would still occasionally run into each other
during their shoots. Complicating matter s was the weather which was fairly cold at 21 degrees FahrenheitFilming(-6 °C) along with a windchill factor of minus 6 (-21 °C). Nevertheless, disru ption was at a minimum,
with Geoc aris recalling that "people on the parade route were laughing as Tommy Lee Jones chased
Harrison Ford...It was a fun thing for them."[14]
Cinematographer Michael Chapman  credits Andrew Davis for the film's distinctive use of Chicago ,
which drew much praise upon its release. "A lot of it really feels like Chica go, because it just has a
native's eye to it. That's Andy's, not mine. He knew where to look."[15] Chap man was actually hired a
week into production after his predece ssor was fired, and he claims he only took the job because the
money was too good. Throughout the production, Chapman would go back and forth between
documentary and theatrical methods, using handheld cameras and natural light for scenes like the first
house raid and then adding unexpected light sources throughout the tunnel chase as the realistic absence
of light was deemed unfeasible.[16] Though his work was later recognized with an Academy Award
nomination, Chapman said it was an unhappy experience as he never got along with Davis. "I said 'I
hated being there' and 'I was the wrong guy' and cursed...but it all worked out, so you never know ."[16]
Much of the film was rewritten throughout production and typically on the day each scene was supposed
to shoot. According to Davis, he never met with credited screenwriter David Twohy, whose main
contribution was writing the train crash. Beyond that, Davis said "he wasn't involved in anything we did.
Jeb Stuart was there with us...basically responding to things we were coming up with all the time...
[Warner Bros.] can't talk about this because of the Writers Guild, but Tommy Lee Jones, myself, Harrison
[Ford] and other people who were close with us, especially coming up with the whole plot about the
pharmaceuticals, they were uncredited writers."[17] Jane Lynch, who was cast as Dr. Kathy Wahlund in
one of her first film roles, recalled having that experience, with both Harrison Ford and herself working
out new dialogue for their scene right before they filmed it, as Harrison Ford "didn't like the scene as it
was written."[18]
Given Harrison Ford's limited window of availability , Andrew Davis had only ten weeks to edit, mix and
finish the film between the last day of shooting and the day it opened in theaters.[17] To meet their
schedule, producer Peter MacGregor -Scott set up seven editing suites at Warner Hollywood Studios and
had a team of editors cutting around the clock as they each worked on different scenes.[19] Each editor
would be recognized for their work on the film with an Academy Award nomination.
James Newton Howard  composed the film's musical score, which Janet Maslin  of The New York Times
called "hugely ef fective".[20]
James Newton Howard had a difficult time scoring the film, recalling that "The Fugitive  really kicked my
ass. When I was hired for it, I was terrified." He became more desponden t after listening to Jerry
Goldsmith 's work, which he had been using as placeholders for scenes that needed music. Howard wasn't
confident that he could match the quality of those temporary cues, but he refused to quit, eventually
conceding that his score would be a "quasi-failure". He was particularly dissatisfied with his work on the
chase scenes, believing his string arrangements were too awkward. When he was given an Academy
Award nomination, James Newton Howard said "I was completely shocked. I just didn't think [my score]
was worth y of a nomination, but that's often what happens. It worked, and the movie was so good. It
makes everybody look better ."[21]MusicThe Fugitive: Limited Edition

Reception
Box office
Critical responseLike the cult television series that
inspired it, the film has a Kafkaesque
view of the world. But it is larger and
more encompassing than the series:
Davis paints with bold visual strokes
so that the movie rises above its
action-film origins and becomes
operatic.
—Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-
Times[47]Desson Howe , writing in The Washington Post, called the
film "A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills
—without a single lapse of subtlety—"Fugitive" is pure
energy, a perfect orchestration of heroism, villainy , suspense
and comic relief. Ford makes the perfect rider for a project
like this, with his hangdog-handsome everyman presence.
He's one of us—but one of us at his personal best. It's great
fun to ride along with him."[48] Left impressed, Rita
Kempley also writing in The Washington Post, surmised
how the filmed contained "Beautifully matched adversaries"
figuring, "One represents the law, the other justice—and it's
the increasingly intimate relationship between them that
provides the tensio n. Otherwise, 'The Fugi tive' would be
little more than one long chase scene, albeit a scorchingly paced and innovative one."[49] In a mixed
review , Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle  wrote that "Direct or Davis valiantly tries to keep the
breakneck, harried pace of an actual flight going throughout, and only occasionally drops the ball (the
film's convoluted conspiracy ending is the first example to beat me about the face and neck just now—
others will crop up after deadline, I'm sure)." Of the lead actor's performance he said, "Ford may be the
closest thing we have these days to a Gary Cooper , but really , where's David Janssen  when we really need
him?"[50] Owen Gleiberman  of Entertainment Weekly said that the film was about "two chases, two
suspense plots running on parallel—and finally conver gent—tracks. Kimble and Gerard spend the entire
film on opposite sides of the law. Before long, though, we realize we're rooting  for both of them; they're
both prota gonists, united in brains, dedication, superior gamesmanship. The film's breathless momentum
springs from their jaunty competitive ur gency ."[51] In a 2018 review for The Atlantic , Soraya Roberts says
the film is "notable  for being the best of a genre that no longer really exists: the character -driven
Hollywood action movie for adults".[52]
The film was not without its detractors. Geof f Andrew of Time Out viewed the film as "A glossy , formula
chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences". The critic added, "Ford is up to
par for the strenuous stuff, but falls short on the grief, anxiety and compassion, allowing Tommy Lee
Jones to walk away  with the show as the wisecracking marshal on Kimble's trail."[53] Colu mnist Ethan
Ham writi ng for the Bright Lights Film Journal  speculate d that supporting actor Tommy Lee Jones'
character was "much more disturbing  than the inept police." Later explaining, "In Kimble's first
encounter with Gerard, Kimble says, 'I didn't kill her!' Gerard responds, 'I don't care. '"[54] In the Chicago
Sun-T imes, noted film critic Roger Ebert  voiced his enthusiasm with the film observing, "The device of
the film is to keep Kimble only a few steps ahead of his pursuers. It is a dangerous strategy , and could
lead to laughable close calls and near-misses, but Davis tells the story of the pursuit so clearly on the
tactical level that we can always unders tand why Kimble is only so far ahead, and no further . As always,
Davis uses locations not simply as the place where action occurs, but as part of the reason for the
action."[47] Rating the film with three stars, James Berardinelli  of ReelV iews professed, "Following the
opening scenes, we're treated to over a half-hour of nonstop action as Gerard  and his men track down
Kimble. Directed and photographed with a flair, this part of the movie keeps viewers on the edges of their
seats. Most importantly , when on the run, Kimble acts like an intelligent human being. Equally as
refreshing, the lawmen are his match, not a bunch of uniformed dunces being run around in circles."[55]Harrison Ford, bearded and numb with
grief, breathes new life into the role
last played by the stoic David Janssen
some 26 years ago. Janssen played
Kimble as the Lone Ranger with a
stethoscope, moving from town to
town, but Ford takes a darker , more
gothic approach.
—Rita Kempley, writing in The Washington
Post[49]For the most part, satisfied with the quality of the motion
picture, Jonathan Rosenbaum  of the Chicago Reader  said
that "The mystery itself is fairly routine , but Jones's offbeat
and streamlined performance as a proudly diffident [sic]
investigator helps one overlook the mechanical crosscutting
and various implausibilities, and director Andrew Davis
does a better -than-average job with the action
sequences."[56] Leonard Klady writing in Variety  exclaimed,
"This is one film that doesn't stint on thrills and knows how
to use them. It has a sympathetic lead, a stunning antagonist,
state-of-the-art special effects, top-of-the-line craftsmanship
and a taut screenplay that breathes life into familiar
territory ."[57] Film  critic Chris Hicks of the Deser et News accounted for the fact that the film "has holes in
its plotting that are easy to pick apart and characters that are pretty thin, bolstered by the performances of
seasoned vets who know how to lend heft to their roles." But in summary he stated, "the film is so stylish,
so funny and so heart-stopping in its suspense that the audience simply doesn't care about flaws".[58]
The film was nominated and won several awards in 1993–1994.[59] Various film critics included the film
on their lists of the top 10 best films for that year; including Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times who
named it the fourth best film of 1993.[60]AccoladesAward Category Nominee Result

In 1998, a parody film Wrongfully Accused , based on The Fugitive , was developed with
Leslie Nielsen  portraying the principal character . Although the film spoofs many other motion
pictures such as Mission: Impossible  and Titanic , the storyline revolves around Nielsen's
character being framed for a murder , as he escapes from federal custody to seek out the
real suspect behind the crime.[85]
