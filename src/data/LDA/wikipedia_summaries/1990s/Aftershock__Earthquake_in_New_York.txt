at high school. She expresses annoyance at his quitting
to get "revenge" against the "stupid " mayor over
budgeting issues. At the courthouse, Joshua is found
not guilty of murdering his invalid wife. Diane meets
her father for lunch to get money . When she leaves, she
catches a cab driven by recent Russ ian immigrant
Nikolai Karvoski (Fred Weller). A massi ve earthqu ake
hits the city, toppling many buildings and structures.
Nikolai's cab is smashed by falling debris, forcing
Nikolai and Diane to flee down the street. A gas main
explodes as the sidewalk pushes up between them.
Diane saves his life after he falls and catches on fire. In
the subway  tunnel, the train Evie and Joshua are riding derails after the tunnel collapses. After the
earthquake stops, Diane, accompanied by Nikolai, goes back to the restaurant and finds her father fatally
injured. He dies after telling her he is proud of her. In the subway , Joshua wants to leave the badly injured
driver and any other survivors to get out, but before he can convince Evie and the others to leave they
hear someone calling for help.
Chief Ahearn returns to his fire station to find the building partially collapsed. With the central dispatch
system down, he contacts Jillian Parnell (Erika Eleniak-Gogli a), a reporter for WCBS-TV , who is flying
over the city, to get an update on the situation. Both 1 Police Plaza  and City Hall have collapsed, and he
asks them  to come pick him up. At the church, an injured Emily wakes up to find a teenage boy (Ray J)
that she helped get a job there is searching her wallet, but moves to try to find a way out after seeing she
is still alive. Despite  her protests, Nikolai initially remains with Diane as she tries to find her mother , but
they eventually part ways. Ahearn sees that his daughter's school has collapsed, but continues on to
Central Park where a temporary camp  is being set up. He finds the Mayor and they agree to ignore
Ahearn's resignation and put aside their differences to help the citizens of their city. A large break in the
sewer is causing hundreds of gallons of water to begin flooding into the subway system.
Ahearn goes to his daughter's school after learning there are survivors. Christine is among the three
survivors, but she dies during an aftershock before they can free her. At the church, Emily learns that the
boy has no name, just a street name. She asks him to take the name of her late son, Clayton, who died as a
baby . Shortly after, he is able to escap e through a break in the ceiling and get help. Dori arrives at
Danny's school where she learns he is stuck on the top floor and rescue efforts are failing. Sam arrives as
Dori prepa res to scale the building to save their son. Diane finds looters in her mother's apartment, but
Nikolai arrives and finds a note saying her mother is at a friends. The mayor arrives at the hospital where
he learns his mother  is dead. He thanks Clayton for trying to help her and asks Ahearn to try to help the
boy, who is despondent over not being able to save her .
In the subway , Joshua, Evie, and one other survivor , Allen (Roger R. Cross), break from the others and
find a ladder out. Joshua climbs up, followed by Evie. As Allen is climbing, Joshua breaks the ladder . He
confirms Evie's growing suspicions that he did kill his wife and attacks her. When he hears someone
coming, he tries to escape up another ladder but an aftershock breaks it and he is killed. Evie points her
rescuers to where the other survivors are waiting. Dori successfully climbs the school, where Danny has
to jump into her arms. The cable breaks , but they land safely on an inflated mat below and are reunited
with Sam.A year later, the city is shown still being rebuilt; Mayor Lincoln and Ahearn are now close friends; Dori
and Sam are shown teaching Danny how to rock-climb; and Diane is a prima ballerina  and married to
Nikolai.
The film is based on a novel written by New York City news anchorman  Chuck Scarborough .[1] He wrote
the book to note that while a quake of the size in his story is extremely unlike ly in the Big Apple, it is
technically not impossible and preparation should not be completely absent from local disaster plans.
Aftershock: Earthquake in New York cost RHI Enter tainment  (form erly Hallmark) $20 million dollars to
produce. It was filmed in Vancouver , Canada, with digital effects and models used to simulate New York
City. In the film, the Statue of Liberty  is destroy ed by the earthquake, an effect that required the special
effects team to construct a 24-foot-tall fiberglass model. It took six weeks to complete the model, then on
the first shoot, the model fell in the wrong direction and had to be recreated. Model trains were used to
produce most of the subway-derailments. For the subway car's final tipping scene, the actors were
harnessed into a life-sized subway car which was rigged to tip over on command. Actress Lisa Nicole
Carson quipped that the harness was "like something you'd find in an S&M  store".[2]
As part of her preparation for the role of Diane Agostini, actress Jennifer Garner had to have her ears
pierced especially for the very first time at the age of 27. After filming was completed, she then stopped
wearing earrings and allowed the piercings to close up again.[3]
Aftershock: Earthquake in New York was initially aired in the United States  in 1999 on CBS  as a two-
part, four-hour miniseries . The first part aired Sunday , November 14, and the second followed on
Tuesday , November 16.[1] It was released to VHS  format by Hallmark Entertainment  on October 17,
2000; and on Region 1  DVD  by Artisan Entertainment  on February 20, 2001.[4][5]
The miniseries aired in Germany as Aftershock - Das große Beben . It was released, under the title New
York - Der Jüngste Tag, in a two-tape VHS  format and a single disc DVD by WVG Medien  in April
2001.[6][7]
In 2000, Aftershock: Earthqu ake in New York was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding
Special Visual Effects.[8] Michal Suchánek was nominated for a 1999 Young Artist Award  in the "Best
Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot - Young Actor Age Ten or Under" category .[9]
Sight & Sound 's Danny Leigh felt the film was "predictabl[y] histrionic", excessively long, and
"geologically impro babl[e]".[10] Ray Richmond of Variety  found the film to be "roundly insipid" and a
"mope opera that follows such a well-tr od crisis path that viewers can set their watches by". Though he
highly praised the film's special effects as being "sharp and impactful without being at all obtrusive", and
noted the film had a talented cast, he panned the story for being unrealistic and lacking genuineness.[1]Production
Release
ReceptionThe New York Times Ron Wertheimer felt the numerous subplots left the film feeling fragmented and
confusing, and that it presented New York in an unrealistic light, even before the earthquake hits. Noting
that the film has "hints of heartfelt drama, flashes of compelling characters, [and] echoes of true
connection," he felt some of the film's best moments came in its smaller scenes. He criticized Lawrence's
performance, but praised Dutton and Skerrit's, particularly their interactions together , stating "their scenes
provide a strong argument for letting television drama do what it does best: focus on the details of human
interaction."[11]Tom Shale s of The Washington Post gave the film a more positive review , calling it "one of the best
disaster movies ever made for television" and a "fabulously entertaining ordeal". He praised the
characters for being sympathetic, the actors for portraying them well, and director Salomon for his skill in
building the film's suspense.[12]
