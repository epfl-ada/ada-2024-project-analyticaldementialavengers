Critical reception for the film has been mixed. The
Stranger  criticized it, saying  that although it "makes
the most of its tiny budget" it was ultimately "inarticulate and immature ".[7] Sam Adams of the
Philadelphia City Paper  admitted that the film was "not without its flaws" but was ultimately "a bold,
ballsy and attention-getting debut".[8] Total Film  panned it, giving the DVD release two stars and calling
it a "yawn  fest".[9] James Berardinelli  gave  it three and a half stars, praising DiNovis's performance.[10]
In The A.V. Club , Noel Murray called it "memorable, but...also grubby , harsh, and lacking in wit".[11]Plot
Cast
ReceptionLeonard Klady wrote in Variety  that it was "disturbing, hard-edged tale of physical abuse and sexual
aberration that pulls no punches" but that it was ultimately "decidedly for niche tastes".[4] Roger Ebert
selected it for his first Overlooked Film Festival  in 1999[12] in Champaign, Illinois .[5]
