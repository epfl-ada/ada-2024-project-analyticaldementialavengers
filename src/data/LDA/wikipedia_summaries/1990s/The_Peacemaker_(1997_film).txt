The Peacemaker (1997 film)
The Peac emaker  is a 1997  America n political  action
thriller film starring Geor ge Clooney , Nicole Kidman ,
Armin Mueller -Stahl , Marcel Iureș and Aleksandr
Baluev  and direc ted by Mimi Leder . It is the first film
by DreamW orks Pictures . While the story takes place
all over the world, it was shot primar ily in Slovakia
with some sequences filmed in New York City and
Philadelphia .[2]
The basis for the film was the 1997 book One Point
Safe by Andrew Cockburn  and Leslie Cockburn , abou t
the state of Russia's nuclear arsenal.[3]
Outside a church celebrating an Eastern Orthodox
baptism  in Pale, Bosnia , the Bosnian Finance Minister ,
a moderate pushing for peace in the ongoing Yugoslav
Wars, is murdered.
At a missile base in Kartaly  (Chelyabinsk Oblast ),
Russia , ten nuclear warheads that belong to a SS-18
Satan  ICBM are loaded onto a train for transport to a
dismantling facility . However , Russian Army General
Aleksandr Kodorof f, along with a rogue  Spetznaz  unit,
kills the soldiers on board and transfers nine warheads
to another train.
Kodorof f then activates the timer on the remaining
warhead and sends the transport on a collision course
with a passenger train. The 500-kiloton warhead
eventually detonates , killing thousands of civilians and
delaying an investigation of the accident.
The detonation attracts the attention of the US
government . Dr. Julia Kelly , head of the NSC  Nuclear
Smuggling Group, believes that Chechen  terrorists are
behind the incident.
Former US Army Ranger  and Special Forces  turned
Military Intelligence Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that thePlotSerbo-Croatian
Budget $50 million[1]
Box office $110.4 million[1]incident was staged to hide the hijacking of the
warheads. A call to Devoe's friend and Russian
counterpart, FSB Colonel Dimitri Vertikof f, adds
reliability to his theory , and he is assig ned as Kelly's
military liaison.
Kelly and Devoe secure information about the terrorists' hijacking operation through an Austrian trucking
company that works as a front for the Russian Mafia . They meet Vertikof f in Vienna  and assume
identities to visit Shummaker , who or ganizes the Russian trucking.
After Devoe tortures Shummaker for information, he and Kelly leave the building and get in Vertikof f's
car. They are chased  by Shumaker's men, who kill Vertikof f while he is offering  a bribe. Devoe shoots at
the attackers and drives away but finds he and Kelly are being followed. Another chase ensues, followed
by a crash, but Devoe and Kelly escape.
Information from the trucking company says that the nukes are going to Iran via Azerbaijan . When US
spy satellites place the truck in a traffic jam of refugees in Dagestan , Devoe uses a ruse to identify it. This
information is passed on to Russian authorities, hoping to stop the transfer to Iran. The Russian military
stops Kodorof f at a roadblock, but he and his men kill the soldiers.
Devoe leads an airborne Special Operations  team from a U.S. base in Turkey  to stop them. Denied entry
into Russi an airspace, one of the three Special Ops helicopters is shot down by a Russian missile , but the
remaining two manage to locate Kodor off's truck. Firing missiles which disable Kodorof f's truck, they
then enga ge in a gunfight, killing Kodorof f and securing the warheads. However , interrogation of the
group's surviving member , a U.S.-educated Pakistani nuclear scientist, reveals that one warhead had been
sent of f with an operative before the truck was intercepted.
The information from the trucking company leads IFOR  to a Sarajevo  address. Inside is a video cassette
of Dušan Gavrić, a Bosnian  who disclaims allegiance to any particular faction in the Yugoslav Wars, but
blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the conflict. Kelly's further analysis of the
trucking company documents suggests that Gavrić intends to bomb a meeting at the UN headq uarters  in
NYC . Gavrić arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation, having replaced the murdered
Finance Minister .
Gavrić actually wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter , who died in Sarajevo during a sniper
attack. He and his brother are later found by Devoe and Kelly . When his brother is killed by Devoe, a
wounded and enraged Gavrić flees into a parochial school. Devoe and Kelly confront Gavrić, who
commits suicide , knowing that the bomb is set to go of f in minutes.
With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly manages to remove part of the bomb's explosive lens shell and stop
the primary explosion from establishing critical mass  within the plutonium core. The primary explosives
detonate, wrecking the church, as Devoe and Kelly dive out of a window . However , Kelly's efforts
prevent it from causing a nuclear explosion.Kelly later is seen swimming laps in a pool. Devoe stops by and asks her out for a drink, which she
accepts.

The Peacemaker  is inspir ed by an unpublished Vanity Fair article written by journalists Andrew
Cockburn  and Leslie Redlich Cockburn .[4] The film marked the inaugural release from DreamW orks
Pictures .[4] Geor ge Clooney  had initially been set to do a Green Hornet  movie at Universal Pictures
starring alongside Jason Scott Lee with Sam Raimi  direc ting, but as DreamW orks' co-fou nder Steven
Spielber g's other company Amblin Television  produced ER, Clooney opted to sign on for The
Peacemaker .[4]
In retrospect, Director Mimi Leder said: “I wish they would make more movies like that," she admits
wistfully . "And I would make them because that's what I'm interested in! It was a very exciting
experience to be able to keep The Peacemaker  grounded in the real world. We actually shot the New York
chase sequences first, and we were working at such a high level. We were like, 'Is it too big?' But you
can't be too big in a chase where you're trying to save the world from a nuke!"[5]Cast

Box officeThe Peacemaker  earned $41,263,140 in the US and $69,200,000 elsewhere, bringing its total to
$110,463,140.[1]
On the review aggregator  website Rotten Tomatoes , 46% of 37 critics ' reviews are positi ve, with an
average rating of 6/10.[6] Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 43 out
of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[7] Audience s polled by CinemaScore
gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[8]
Janet Maslin  of The New York Times gave praise to Clooney and Kidman for portraying a "charming
rogue" and expressing "womanly professionalism as fierce, hostile sternness" in their respective roles and
Leder's direction of the movie's action setpieces, highlighting the Manhattan climax for having "crisp
economy and furious energy" throughout the scene.[9] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle  said that
despite the "ever -present plot holes and isoscelean character arcs" throughout the film's story and villains,
he praised  Leder's directorial skills for keeping things fresh throughout the runtime and adding "clever
swagger" to the action scenes, conclu ding that: "By no means an embarrassment to the fledgling
DreamW orks, The Peacemaker  is instea d a grand, noisy step in the right direction. What next,
indeed?"[10] Roger Ebert commend ed the "technical credits" and both Clooney and Kidman for expertly
fulfilling their roles but felt the rest of the film was filled with "retreaded" and "off-the-shelf" thriller
clichés and concluded with a bomb defusal third act that lacked the "real endings involving character
developments and surprises" found in similar films like The Edge and Kiss the Girls .[11] Entertainment
Weekly 's Owen Gleiberman  gave the film an overall "C+" grade, giving Leder's direction credit for
staging her scenes with "crisp exactitu de, [and with] a pleasing flair for "rhythmic" visual detail" and
adding "elegant and accomplished" atmo spherics, but felt that it amounts to being "a well-crafted, utterly
generic genre piece" that carries "an air of self-important solemnity that borders on the overblown",
concluding that: "In The Peacemaker , nothing escapes the taint of cliche. As the inaugural feature from
DreamW orks, the picture is vaguely depressing, because it suggests that the studio’ s creators are working
so laborio usly to manufacture a hit that they’ve forgotten to put in the dream ."[12] James Berardinelli
criticized the over-long runtime of the movie's "paper -thin plot", the "lack of creativity" in the death
scenes and failing to sympathize with the villains' plight, concluding that: "The Peacemaker  isn't much
better or worse than the average James Bond  movie, except, of course, that it doesn't have the cars, the
gadgets, the girls, or Bond himself. There's a certain appeal to the premise, but the execution is uneven.
The movie is likely to keep an audience's attention, but it's the kind of film that is quickly for gotten."[13]
