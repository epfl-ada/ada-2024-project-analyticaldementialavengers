Paint Your Wagon (film)
Paint Your Wagon  is a 1969 Americ an Western[5]
musical film starring Lee Marvin , Clint Eastwood , and
Jean Seberg. The film was adapted  by Paddy
Chayefsky  from the 1951 musical Paint Your Wagon
by Lerner and Loewe . It is set in a mining  camp in
Gold Rush -era California . It was directed by Joshua
Logan .
When a wagon  crashes into a ravine, prospector  Ben
Rumson finds two adult occupants, brothers, one of
whom is dead and the other of whom has a broken arm
and leg. During the dead man's burial, gold dust is
discovered at the grave site. Ben stakes a claim on the
land and adopts the surviving brother as his "Pardner"
while he recuperates.
Pardner hopes to make enough in the gold rush to buy
some land and is suspicious of the fast-living Ben. Ben
claims that while he is willing to fight, steal, and cheat
at cards, he will never betray a partner . Ben will share
the spoils of prospecting on the condition that Pardner
take care of him in his moments of drunkenness and
melancholy .
After the discovery of gold, "No Name City" springs
up as a tent city, with the miners alternating between
wild parties and bouts of loneliness. The men become
frustrated with the lack of female companionship, and
the arrival of Jacob Woodling, a Mormon  with two
wives , is enough to catch everyone's attention. The
miners persuade Woodling to sell one of his wives to
the highest bidder . Elizabeth, Jacob's younger wife,
agrees to be sold, as she is unsatisfied with her current
husband.
Still drunk, Ben winds up with the highest bid for
Elizabeth. After being readied for the wedding by the
other miners, he is married to Elizabeth under "miningPlotconducted by Nelson

Elizabeth, not content to be seen as property , threatens
to shoot Ben on their wedding night if she is not
treated with respect. Despite believing Ben is not the
type to settle down, she views their arrangement as
acceptable if he will build a cabin to provide her with
some security for when he inevitably  leaves. Ben,
impressed by her determination, enlists the miners to
help him keep this promise, and Elizabeth rejoices in
having a proper home.
News comes of the pending arrival of "six French
tarts" to a neighboring town via stagecoach . A plan is
hatched to divert the stagecoach under false pretenses
and bring the women to "No Name City", thus
providing the other miners with female companionship. Ben heads up the missio n and leaves Elizabeth in
the care of Pardner . The two fall in love. Elizabeth, also still loving Ben, convinces them that "if a
Mormon man can have two wives, why can't a woman have two husbands?" The polyandrous
arrangement works until the town beco mes large enough that civilized peopl e begin to settle there. A
parson begins to make a determined effort to persuade the townsfolk to give up their evil ways.
Meanwhile, Ben and a group of miners  discover that gold dust is dropping through the floor boards of
many saloons. They tunnel under all the businesses to get the gold.
A group of new settlers is rescued from the snow , and the strait-laced family is invited to spend the winter
with Elizabeth and Pardner , who is assumed to be her only husband. Ben is left to fend for himself. In
revenge, he introduces one of the family , the naive Horton Fenty , to the pleasu res of a local saloon  and
brothel . This leads to Elizabeth dismissing both Ben and Pardner from the log cabin, and Pardner takes to
gambling. During a bull-and-bear fight, the rampaging bull falls into the tunnel complex dug by Ben and
the others and knocks out all of the support beams, causing the streets and buildings to collapse.
Eventually , the town is destroyed entire ly. Ben departs for other gold fields. Before this, Pardner reveals
his real name to Ben: Sylvester Newel. Elizabeth and Pardner reconcile and plan to stay .

Multiple attempts were made to adapt Alan Jay Lerner 's Paint Your Wagon  into a film. Warner Bros.
considered making the film with Doris Day and Paramount Pictures  considere d making  it with Bing
Crosby . Louis B. Mayer  purchased the film rights before his death in 1957, and Paramount bought the
rights from his estate.[7]Musical numbers

ProductionLerner , who wrote the screenplays for An Americ an in Paris , Gigi, and My Fair Lady , produced  the film.
Lerner selected Joshua Logan , who previously directed the film adaption  of Lerner's Camelot , to direct
the film. Blake Edwards  wanted to direct the film, but Lerner declined his offer and Edwards instead
directed Darling Lili. The plot was significantly changed from the stage play. Lerner attempted to have
Frederick Loewe  compose the film's soundtrack, but he declined and instead suggested André Previn .[8]
Clint Eastwood  was selec ted instea d of Geor ge Maharis .[9] Lee Marvin  accepted the lead role instead of
appearing in The Wild Bunch .[3] He received $1 million, while Eastwood was paid $750,000.[3][10] Faye
Dunaway ,[11] Mia Farrow[12] and Tuesday Weld[13] turned down the role of Elizabeth befor e Seber g was
cast. Julie Andrews , Sally Ann Howes , and Diana Rigg  were also considered for the role.[3][9] Lesley Ann
Warren , who was under contract to Paramount, had to bow out after she became pregnant.[14]
Eastwood and Marvin did their own singing, while Seber g's songs were dubbed by Anita Gordon . Agnes
de Mille  was asked to choreograph the film, but declined.[9][15]
Paint Your Wagon  was shot near Baker City, Oregon , with filming beginning in May 1968 and ending
that October .[3] Othe r locations included Big Bear Lake , California , and the San Bernardino National
Forest ; the interiors were filmed at Paramount Studios , with Joshua Logan  directing. The film's initial
budget was $10 million, before it eventually doubled to $20 million. A daily expense of $80,000 was
incurred to transport cast and crew to the filming location, as the closest hotel was nearly 60 miles away .
The elaborate camp used in the film cost $2.4 million to build.[3][16]
A rainstorm destroyed the road connect ing the set to Baker City and Paramount had to pay $10,000 per
mile to rebuild the road. Lerner almost fell down a 400-foot cliff during filmin g. Hippies who had been
cast as extras formed a union and threatened to strike unless their daily pay was increased to $25.[17]
The film was released at a time when movie musicals  were going out of fashion, especially with younger
audiences. Its overblown budget and nearly three-hour length became notorious in the press. Eastwood
was frustrated by the long delays in the making of the film, later saying that the experience strengthened
his resolv e to become a director . Acco rding to Robert Osborne , Marvin drank heavily during filming,
which may have enhanced his screen appearance, but led to delays and many retakes.
Paint Your Wagon  opened at Loew's State II theatre in New York City on October 15, 1969.[1] In the UK,
Paint Y our W agon  had a 79-week 70mm roadshow run at the Astoria Theatre  in London .
Vincent Canby , in his October 16, 1969, review for The New York Times, wrote that the film was
"amiable... However , because amiabili ty is never in over-abundant supply , especially in Hollywood
super -productions, the movie can be enjoyed more than simply tolerated." He ended the review by
expanding on its pleasantness:Release
Reception
Critical responseMost of the time, Paint Your Wagon  is very easy to take, as amiable as Marvin, Eastwood, and
Miss Seber g, whose contemporary movie presences give an old property brand-new cool.
On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on reviews from 21 critics.[18]
The film grossed $50,506 in its first week.[19] It opened in Los Angeles  the following week[1] and
immediately expanded to another 12 cities.[20] It reached number one at the US box office in its eighth
week of release.[21] Due to its large budget and disappointing returns, Paramount took an initial write-of f
of $11 million; however , the film performed better during the summer of 1970 and they reversed around
$6 million of the write off.[22] The film became Paramount's sixth-lar gest success up to that point (and the
seventh highest-grossing film of 1969); over its release, it grossed $31.6 million, although the earnings
never of fset the cost of production and marketing.[23]

Marvin's rendition of "Wand'rin' Star," accompanied by the film's choir , became a number one hit in the
UK.[24] His voice was described by Jean Seber g as "like rain gurgling down a rusty pipe". Interviewed on
NPR , Marvin said that the song was a hit in Australia, and someone there described  it as "The first 33 ⅓
recorded at 45."
