The Kingdom of the Fairies
The Kingdom of the Fairies  (French : Le Royaume des
fées),[2][3] initially released in the United State s as
Fairyland, or the Kingdom of the Fairies  and in Great
Britain as The Wonders of the Deep, or Kingdom of
the Fairies ,[1] is a 1903 French silent  trick film
directed by Geor ges Méliès .
The film historian Geor ges Sadoul  suggested that the
film was freely adapted from La Biche au Bois, a
popular féerie  by the brothers Goignard, which had
been first produced in March 1845 at the Théâtre de la
Porte Saint-Martin  and which was frequently revived
throughout the nineteenth century .[4] A publication on
Méliès's films by the Centre national du cinéma  cites
Charles Perrault 's story "Sleeping Beauty " as the most
direct inspiration for the film, with the seven fairies in
that tale reduced to four .[4]
The film's cast includes Geor ges Méliès  as Prince Bel-
Azor , Marguerite Thévenard as Princess Azurine, and
Bleuette Bernon  as the fairy Aurora.[5] Sadoul,
examining a production still from the film, identified the actor Durafour as a supporting player .[5]
While most of the film was shot indoors, the nuptial cortege scene near the end was filmed outdoors in
Méliès's garden, with a real horse.[4] Special effects in the film were created with stage machinery , rolling
panoramas , miniature models , pyrotechnics , substitution splices , superimpositions , and dissolves .[4]
The Kingdom of the Fairies  was relea sed by Méliès's Star Film Company  and is numbered 483–498 in its
catalogues.[1] (In Méliès's numbe ring system, films were listed and numbered according to their order of
production, and each catalogue number  denotes about 20 meters of film.)[6] The film was regis tered for
American copyright at the Library of Congress  on 3 September 1903.[1]
According to the Méliès scholar John Frazer , the film was "the most ambitious Star Film production to
date" and "was widely distributed and heavily promoted."[7] An origin al film score was prepa red for the
film's projection in larger cities.[7] As with at least 4% of Méliès's entire output (including such films as AProduction
ReleaseThe full filmTrip to the Moon , The Impossible Voyage , The Rajah's Dream, and
The Barber of Seville ), some prints were individually hand-colored
and sold at a higher price.[8]
The Kingdom of the Fairies , like Méliès's similarly spectacular
films A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impo ssible Voyage
(1904), was one of the most popular films of the first few years of
the twentie th century .[9] When Thomas L. Tally debuted the film at
his Lyric Theater in Los Angeles in 1903 (billing it as "Better than A Trip to the Moon "), the Los Angeles
Times called the film "an interesting exhibit of the limits to which moving picture making can be carried
in the hands of experts equipped with time and money to carry out their devices."[10]
The film theorist Jean Mitry  called it "undoubtedly Méliès's best film, and in any case the most intensely
poetic."[11]
ReceptionPrints of the film survive in the film archives of the British Film Institute  and the Library of Congress .[12]
