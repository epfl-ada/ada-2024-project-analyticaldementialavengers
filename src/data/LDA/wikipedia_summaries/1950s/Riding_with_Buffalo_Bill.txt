Riding with Buffalo Bill
Riding with Buffalo Bill is a 1954 American Western
Serial film directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet and
starring Marshall Reed .
Buffalo Bill Cody comes to aid the miner Rocky Ford
and a group of ranchers in their defeat of a local crime
lord, King Carney , who is trying to keep the new
railroad out of the territory in order to carry on with his
illegal operations. Rocky then asks Cody to don the
disguise of a legendary masked man, known as The
Ridin' Terror, who once before smashed outlaw rule in
the area. In response, Cody enlists the support of
Rocky , the settler Reb Morgan and his sister Ruth, and
plans offensive strategy to eradicate Carney and his
outlaws.
