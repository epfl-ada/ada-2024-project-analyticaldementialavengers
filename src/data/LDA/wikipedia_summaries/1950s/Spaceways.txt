Engineer Dr Stephen  Mitchell is part of a British space
programme that plans to launch a satellite that will
permanently orbit Earth. At a cocktail party , it is
announced to the programme's staff that the satellite
project has been approved by the defence council.
Mitchell's wife Vanessa is not enthusiastic about the
new projec t, nor with having to live at its high security
base. She sneaks away with Dr Philip Crenshaw , with
whom she is having an affair. Dr Mitchell leaves the
party with Lisa Frank, a mathematician on the project,
who is in love with him. When Mitchel l returns home,
he has an argument with Vanessa; he has been made
aware of her havin g passionately kissed Crenshaw
after she left with him.
The satellite rocket soon launches, but it does not reach
its maxim um altitud e. Afterwards, it is discovered that
Crenshaw and Vanessa have disappea red. Dr Smith
secretly investigates their disappearance  and comes to
the conclusion that not only were the two murdered,
but that they were murdered by Dr Mitchell, after
which he hid their bodies in the spacecr aft's fuel tanks.
Smith approaches Mitchell with the accusation, while
also telling him about Crenshaw being a spy, who had
concealed having a degree from a German university .PlotRunning time 76 minutes
Country United Kingdom
Language EnglishMitchell decides to go into space on the second rocket
being launched, in order to try to prove his innocence.
Smith discovers that there was a new team member
added just prior to the disappearance, and that a
security guard had died in an accident a week earlier .
Soon after, Smith and the police discove r that Crenshaw and Vanessa are actually at a seaside cottage and
rush to intercept them. Crenshaw has been planning to head to the east instead of going to America, as he
previously had said. When Vanessa finds out Crenshaw plans to go to Russia, she refuses to go. Crenshaw
tries to persuade her, but she won't agree. Saying that she knows too much for him to leave her behind,
Crenshaw takes out a gun, intending to kill her. Smith arrives and tries to stop him, but in the violent
scuffle between them the gun goes of f and Vanessa is killed.
After the rocket ship launches into space, Mitchell is surprised to see that Lisa is on board; she had
previously convinced Toby to let her go on the flight instead of him. Despite the revelation that the bodies
of Crenshaw and Vanessa are not on board, Mitchell and Frank attempt to jettison the spaceship's second
stage, resulting in an explosion, causing  their spacecraft to go out of control. Mitchell, however , releases
the fail-safe, saving them from destruction and allowing the spaceship to return safely to Earth.

Principal photography took place at Bray Studios, Windsor , England from mid-November 1952 to early
January 1953.[4] Some of the scenes of the spaceship taking off were special effects shots taken  from the
Lippert film, Rocketship X-M  (1950)[5] Some filming also occurred at Bray Studios  in Berkshire.[6]
Monthly Film Bulletin  said: "The first British science-fiction picture is a dull and shoddy affair. Too much
footage is wasted on a kind of poor man's version of The Net, and the gadgetry and adventures when they
do come are ludicrous and unexciting. Eva Bartok's mathematician may please the connoisseurs."[7]Cast
Production
Critical r eceptionKine Weekly said: "Interplanetary melodrama, artful ly coloured by pseudo-scientific jargon and detail. ...
There is not a great deal of action during the first half, but the shrewd deplo yment of interesting and
widely assorted types rivets the attention  until the space-ship finally comes into its own. ... One of many ,
but better than most '"aerial extravaganzas," it'll entertain youngsters of all ages."[8]
Variety  wrote: "Terence Fisher's direction is extremely methodical, as is the playing, and script constantly
betrays its radio play origin by running to long sides of static dialog. Very little excitement is whipped up,
although the finale rocket flight and danger to the hero and heroine, has a fair amount of suspense. ...
Picture needs considerable editorial tightening."[9]
Boxoffice  said: "The offering is believably plotted and capably enacted, while from the production
standpoint the values of the piece are considerably bolstered by the injection of what appear to be
authentic clips of rocket takeof f and flight. ...To appeal to feminine audiences, a logical romantic thread
has been woven into the story ."[10]
Pictur egoer  wrote: "This is the first British entry in the current cycle of science-fiction. And a pretty
effective job it is, too. ... It is, of course, a melodrama-and-hokum sandwich, but I found it worth a
bite."[11]
In British Sound Films : The Studio Years 1928–1959  David Quinlan rated the film as “mediocre” and
wrote: "Pretty lame British entry into science-fiction."[12]
The Radio Times Guide to Films  gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: "Why did anybody who read the radio
play on which this is based think it was worth doing anything with it other than hurl it across the room?
The plot has leads Howard Duff and Eva Bartok blasting off in pursuit of a satellite to prove Duff's
innocence following  an accusation of double murder . Terence Fisher's funereal pace kills this cheaply-
made picture stone dead long before the dénouement."[13]
Glenn Erickson, writing in DVD Savant , noted: "The disappointment of Spaceways  is finding out that it is
really a lukewarm murder mystery in a science fiction setting".[5]
