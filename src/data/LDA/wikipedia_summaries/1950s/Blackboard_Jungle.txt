Blackboard Jungle
Blackboard Jungle  is a 1955  America n social  drama
film about an English teacher in an interracial inner -
city school, based on the 1954 novel The Blackboar d
Jungle  by Evan Hunter  and adapted for the screen and
directed by Richard Brooks . It is remembered for its
innovative use of rock and roll in its soundtrack, for
casting grown adults as high school teens, and for the
unique breakout role of a black cast member , Sidney
Poitier , as a rebellious yet musically talented student.
In 2016, Blackboar d Jungle  was selected for
preservation in the United States National Film
Registry  by the Library of Congress  as being
"culturally , historically , or aesthetically
significant".[3][4]
In the mid-1950s, Richard Dadier is a new teacher at
North Manual Trades High School, an inner -city
school of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Led by student
Gregory Miller, most engage in anti-s ocial behavior .
The school principal, Mr. Warneke, denies there are
discipline issues, but the school faculty , particularly
Mr. Murdock, warn Dadier otherwise. Dadier befriends
two other new teachers, Joshua Edwards and Lois
Hammond.
Dadier's class includes Miller and Artie West, a
rebellious bully and gang leader . The class shows no
respect for Dadier . Dadier encourages Miller to lead
the class in the right direction. After Dadier subdues a
student who attacks Miss Hammond, the class gives
Dadier the silent treatment and are even more
uncooperative. Dadier and Edwards are mugged by
West's gang.
Reluctant to quit, Dadier seeks advice from his former
teacher , Professor Kraal, the principal of an
academically superior school with disciplined students.
Kraal offers Dadier a job, but he declines. AfterPlotProduction

divisive names, Dadier is himself falsely accused by
Mr. Warneke of using racial epithets in the classroom.
West encounters Dadier during his gang's robbery of a
newspaper truck. West tells Dadier his classroom is on
the streets and to leave him alone. Several students, led
by West, assault Edwards in his classroom and destroy
his music record collection.
Dadier's wife, Anne , who is pregnant, begins receiving
anonymous letters and phone calls telling her Dadier
and Miss Hammond are having an affair. Dadier
discovers Miller can play piano and sing, and wonders
why Miller can show such talent but also be so
rebellious. Dadier shows his class an animated film about "Jack and the Beanstalk " which sparks
discussion about moral choices. Anne goes into premature labor caused by the stress of the phone calls
about Dadier's allege d affair. When a neighbor shows Dadier the anonymous letters, he angrily decides to
quit. Mr. Murdock encourages him to stay, telling Dadier he is making progress and has inspired him too.
Anne apologizes for doubting Dadier's fidelity and says she was wrong for telling him to quit. Their
premature baby boy , though weak, eventually thrives.
When Dadier observes West openly copying from another student, he demands that West bring his paper
to the front to have it docked five points. West rebuf fs his repeated request, but Dadier is unrelenting. The
conflict quickly escalates, and West pulls out a switchblade. Dadier does not back down. Miller stops
West's sidekick and classmate Belazi from jumping Dadier from behind. The rest of West's gang fails to
assist.
Dadier accuses West of the false allegations made to both Mr. Warneke and Anne. Dadier subdues West,
and the other students join in to subdue  Belazi, who has picked up the knife to escape. Miller then leads
the class in helping Dadier take West and Belazi to the principal's office. In the final scene, Miller and
Dadier ask if the other is quitting at the end of the school year. Miller says no, because the two of them
had a pact that neither would quit if the other stayed. Dadier's expression makes clear he has no intention
of breaking the agreement.

later changed his name to Jamie Farr , best known for playing Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger in
the M*A*S*H  TV series.
Hunter's novel was based on his early job as a teacher at Bronx Vocational High School, now known as
Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School  in the South Bronx . Hunter , then known as
Salvatore Lombino, took the teaching job in 1950 after graduating from Hunter College . He was quickly
disillusioned and quit in frustration after two months.[5]
In a positive review , Bosley Crowther  of The New Y ork T imes wrote:
"As a straight melodrama of juvenile violence this is a vivid and
hair-raising film. Except for some incidental romance, involving
the teache r and his wife and a little business about the latter
having a baby , it is as hard and penetrating as a nail."
— Bosley Crowther (1955)[6]
Variety  called it: "...a film with a melodramatic impact that hits hard at a
contemporary problem. The casting, too, is exceptionally good."[7]
Harrison's Reports  called the film: "...a stark, powerful melodrama,
sordid, tense, and disturbing. The picture no doubt will stir up
considerable controv ersy, but at the same time it probably will prove to be
a top box-of fice grosser ."[8]
John McCarten  of The New Y orker  wrote:
"While the film has a good many faults (the acting at times is a bit shaky and the conclusion is
rather unbelievable), it nevertheless confronts its subject matter head on, and in the
circumstances it is an unsettling piece of work."Factual backgr ound
Critical r eception
Positive reviews— John McCarten (1955)[9]
Not all reviews were positive. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post slammed the film as "so
sensationalized as to negate any laudable purpose its supporters claim", further explaining:
"Yes, the papers regularly have news about shocking conditions in the schools. Vandalism
certainly is more rampant than it was only a few years ago. Sex crimes and thuggery do occur .
Even murder is not beyond our young. But to pile these things and more into a few months
within one classroom surely does not show 'courage' on the part of the moviemakers. This
approach simply is one more dodge at making a box office buck to anyone with his eyes open.
This is the Dead End kids , the gangster melodrama, in another setting."
— Richard Coe (1955)[10]
The Monthly Film Bulletin  delivered a mixed to negative assessment:
"Contrived situation s and some rather thin characterisation reduce the impact and effectiveness
of Blackboar d Jungle , both as an exposé of a current American educational problem and a plea
for more strenuous efforts by teachers at similar institutions. Characters such as the flirtatious
woman teacher and the pregnant wife are fictitious trimmings which only emphasise the
artificiality in the handling of the main theme. There are several tense and hard-hitting
sequences, and a general atmosphere of strident earnestness, but only in the tiny part of the
trade school headmaster , played with considerable force by John Hoyt, is there any real
suggestion of complexity or depth."
— Monthly Film Bulletin (October 1955)[11]
The song "Rock Around the Clock " was included in the film, making the recording an anthem for
rebellious 1950s youth.[12] It was Number 1 on the pop charts for two months and went to Number 3 on
the R&B chart.[13]
Rotten Tomatoes  gives the film a "fresh" rating of 76%. On their best of Sidney Poitier list, it says:
"This was the role that put Poitier on the map. The struggles of educators and students are well
documented in this violent and controversial film, based on Evan Hunter's seminal novel about
inner -city school conditions. Modern audiences might struggle to sympathize with the tactics
employed by Poitier's character , Gregory  Miller , but the cultural impact his performance had on
both society and education are undeniable."

In 2010, Turner Classic Movies (TCM)  listed the soundtrack of the movie on its list of the Top 15 Most
Influential Movie Soundtracks of all time. TCM described the impact and the influence of the movie:
MGM brought Holly wood into the rock'n'roll era with BLACKBOARD JUNGLE. In search of
the kind of music teens like the film's potential delinquents were listening to, director Richard
Brooks borrowed a few records from star Glenn Ford's son Peter . When he heard Bill Haley and
his Comets perform 'Rock Around the Clock', he found the perfect theme song -- the first rock
song ever used in a Hollywood feature. Teens flocked to the film, dancing in theatre aisles as
the song played over the opening credit s. Parents may have been shocked by such uninhibited
behavior , but things got worse when screenings also inspired violence and vandalism around
the world.  Thanks to BLACKBOARD  JUNGLE, the song hit number one on the Billboard
charts, eventually selling 25 million copies and becoming what Dick Clark called 'The National
Anthem of Rock 'n' Roll'.[18]
The film marked the rock and roll revolution by featu ring Bill Haley & His Comets ' "Rock Around the
Clock ",[19] initially a B-side , over the film's opening credits (with a lengthy drum solo introduction,
unlike the originally released single), as well as in the first scene, in an instrume ntal version in the middle
of the film, and at the close of the movie, establishing that song as an instant hit. The record had been
released the previous year, gaining only limited sales. But, popularized by its use in the film, "Rock
Around the Clock" reached number one on the Billboar d charts and remained there for eight weeks.[20] InAwards and honors
Cultural impactsome theaters, when the film was in the first release, the song was not heard at all at the beginning of the
film because rock and roll was considered a bad influence. Despite this, other instances of the song were
not cut.
The music led to a large teenage audience for the film, and their exuberant response to it sometimes
overflowed into violence and vandalism at screenings.[21] In this sense, the film has been seen as marking
the start of a period of visible teenage rebellion in the latter half of the 20th century. The film was banned
in Memphis, Tennesse e and Atlanta, Geor gia,[22] with the Atlanta Review Board claiming that it was
"immoral, obscene, licentious and will adversely affect the peace, health, morals and good order of the
city".[23]
The film marked  a watershed in the United Kingdom and was originally refused a cinema certificate
before being passed with heavy cuts. When shown at a south London  cinema in Elephant and Castle  in
1956 the teenage Teddy Boy audience began to riot, tearing up seats  and dancing in the aisles.[24] After
that, riots took place around the country wherever the film was shown.[25]
The 1982 crime  action thriller film Class of 1984  serves as a loose remake of The Blackboar d Jungle ,
with Perry King , Timothy Van Patten  and Michael J. Fox in the roles of Glenn Ford , Vic Morrow , and
Sidney Poitier , respectively .[26]
In 2007, the Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Cultur e published an article that analyzed the film's
connection to crime theories and juvenile delinquency .[27]
In 2015, the Journal of Transnational American Studies  published a study with a focus on the film's
reception in West Germany and Japan.[28]
The influential Jamaican reggae  album Blackboar d Jungle Dub (1973) by The Upsetters  references the
film's title.
The film touches on the still-current issue of teacher pay. The dialog states that in 1955, the pay for
teachers was US$2.00 an hour (equivale nt to $23 in 2023), or about US$4,000 a year salary (equivalent to
$45,496 in 2023), as compared with congressmen and judges at US$9.25 (equivalent to $105 in 2023),
policemen and firemen at US$2.75 (equivalent to $31 in 2023), carpenters at US$2.81 (equivalent to $32
in 2023), plumbers at US$2.97 (equivalent to $34 in 2023), and plasterers  at US$3.21 an hour (equivalent
to $37 in 2023).
In March 2005, the 50th anniversary of the release of the film, which had influenced the subsequent
upsur ge in the general popularity of rock and roll, was marked by a series of "Rock Is Fifty" celebrations
in Los Angel es and New York City, involving  the surviving members of the original Bill Haley & His
Comets.
In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry  by the Library
of Congress .
