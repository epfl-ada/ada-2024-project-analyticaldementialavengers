In The New York Times its anonymous reviewer wrote:
"British restraint in acting and dialogue is almost
painfully evident throughout the proceedings".
Although Milland's acting is praised for its "naturalness, a quality which, it might be added, may be due
in part to the unadorned and often expe rt dialogue turned out by Philip MacDonald", the film despite aCast
Critical r eceptiondecent British supporting cast, "is still an unexciting and largely placid adven ture".[4] Dennis Schwartz
wrote of the film in 2013: "Though routine, the highly skilled Tourneur does his best to keep it lively ,
watchable and enjoyable."[5]
