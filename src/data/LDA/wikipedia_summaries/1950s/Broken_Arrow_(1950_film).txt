Broken Arrow (1950 film)
Broken Arrow is a 1950  American  revisionist Western
film direc ted by Delmer Daves and starring James
Stewart , Jeff Chandler , and Debra Paget . The film is
based on historical figures, but fictionalizes their story
in dramatized form. It was nomina ted for three
Academy Awards , and won a Golden Globe Award  for
Best Film Promoting International Understanding .
Film histo rians have said that the film was one of the
first major Westerns  since the Second World War to
portray Native Americans sympathetically .[2]
Tom Jeffords  comes across a wounded 14-year -old
Apache  boy dying from buckshot  wounds in his back.
The boy first tries to attack him, not believing it
possible that a White man would want to help him, but
Jeffords gives the boy water and treats his wounds,
staying with him until he heals. The Apache boy is
surprised at his goodwill as he is a White man and
supposed to be his enemy . The boy's tribesmen appear
and are initially hostile, but decide to let Jeffords go
free after the boy convinces them that he is a “good”
White man who helped him rather than kill him.
However , when a group of gold prospectors
approaches, the Apache gag Jeffords and tie him to a
tree. Helpless, he watches as they attack the
prospectors and torture the survivors. The warriors
then let him go, but warn him not to enter Apache
territory again.
When Jeffords returns to Tucson, he encounters a
prospector who escaped the ambush. He corrects a
man's exaggerated account of the attack, but Ben Slade
is incredulous and does not see why Jeffords did not
kill the Apache boy. They have a contentious
confrontation and Jeffords defends his choice to do the
right thing , no matter who it was for. Jeffords turns
down the army's request to scout Apache territory for
them and instead learns the Apache language  andPlotRelease date July 20, 1950

Box office $3.6 million (US rentals)[1]customs from an Apache guide who lives amongst the
townspeople. He plans to go to the Apache leader
Cochise 's stronghold on behalf of his friend, Milt, who
is in charge of the mail service in Tucson. The mail has
not been getting through because of Apache raids and
Jeffords thinks this would be a good place to begin a
peace treaty. He enters the Apache stronghold and
begins a parley with Cochise, who agrees to let the mail couriers through after they realize their
underlying morality is similar and Cochise is impressed by Jefford’ s efforts to learn his language and his
bravery for coming to him. Jeffords meets a young Apache woman, Sonseeahra y, and they fall in love at
first sight.
Despite Cochise agreeing to allow the mail to pass through, Apaches attack an army wagon train and kill
the survivors, which was not part of their agreement. The townsfolk try to lynch Jeffords as a traitor for
working with their enemies before he is saved by General Oliver Otis Howard  who recruits him to
negotiate a wider peace treaty with Cochise. Howard, the "Christian General" condemns racism , saying
that the Bible "says nothing about  pigmentation of the skin". They make a peace treaty with Cochise, but
a group led by Geronimo  oppose the treaty and leave the stronghold. When these renegades ambush a
stagecoach, Jeffords rides off to seek help from Cochise and the stagecoach is saved with the Apaches’
help.
Jeffords and Sonseeahray marry in an Apache ceremony and have several days of tranquility . Ben Slade's
son comes to them, telling a story to Jeffords and Cochise about two of his horses stolen by Cochise's
people. Cochise says that his people did not take them and doubts his story , as he knows the boy's father
is an Apac he hater . They nonetheless decide to go along with the boy up the canyon and are ambushed by
the boy's father and a gang of men from  Tucson. Jeffords is shot and badly wounded and Sonseeahray is
shot and killed, but Cochise kills most of the men, including Ben Slade. Cochise forbids Jeffords to
retaliate, saying that the ambush was not done by the American military and that Geronimo broke the
peace no less than Slade and his men, and that peace must be maintained. General Howard arrives with
some of the townsfo lk and informs Jeffords and Cochise that the men who survived the ambush and fled
have been  captured and will be executed for their crime. The townsfolk offer their condolences and
apologize. Jeffords rides off with the belief that "the death of Sonseeahray had put a seal upon the peace,
and from that day on wherever I went, in the cities, among the Apaches and in the mountains, I always
remembered, my wife was with me".

Producer Julian Blaustein recalled: "We had a terrible time locating an actor with the proper voice and
stature to play Cochise . Before we found Chandler we were even considering Ezio Pinza ".[3]
Jeff Chandler was cast in May 1949 on the basis of his performance in Swor d in the Deser t. He was
working in several radio series at the time, Michael Shayne  and Our Miss Brooks, and had to be written
out of them for several weeks.[4]
Filming started on June 6, 1949. It was primarily shot on location in northern Arizona , approximately 30
miles south of Flagstaf f. Apaches  from the Whiteriver agency on the Fort Apac he Indian  Reservation
played themselves.[5] Debra Paget  was only 16 years old when she played the love interest to 42-year -old
James Stewart . Canadian Mohawk  actor Jay Silverheels  portrayed Geronimo .
The film was based on the 558-page novel Blood Brother  (1947) by Elliott Arnold , which told the story of
the peace agreemen t between the Apache  leader Cochise  and the U.S. Army , 1855–18 74. The studio
employed nearly 240 Native Americans  from Arizona's Fort Apache Indian Reservation ; many location
scenes were shot in Sedona, Arizona . The story of Cochise  actually occurred in what is now the Dragoon
Mountains  in the Douglas Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest  in southeastern Arizona. The
studio attempted to portray Apache customs in the film, like the Social Dance and the Girl's Sunrise
Ceremony (the girl's puberty rite). For the character of Cochise , director Daves eliminated the tradition al
style of broken English  and replaced it with conventional English so that White Americans  and Nativ e
Americans would sound alike.[6] An overdub by the character of Jeffords opens the film with a statement
about this.
Although many Western films  of the pre-W orld War II period portrayed the Indigenous peoples of the
Americas  as hostile to the mostly White American settlers, others showed them in a positive light. Broken
Arrow is noteworthy for being one of the first post-war Westerns to portray Native Americans in a
balanced, sympathetic way, helping to bring in the era of the revisionist Western genre. The two principal
Apache characters were played by non-Indigenous actors, with Brooklyn-born Jeff Chandler portraying
Apache  leader Cochise , and White American Debra Paget playing Jimmy Stewart’ s Apache love interest.
Notably , Native Canadian  Moh awk actor Jay Silverheels  played Geronimo, a small part in the film but
recognized at the time as there were few Indigenous actors working in Hollywood.[7] As well, the
majority of extras were played by actual Apaches.
Some scholars have said that the film appealed to an ideal of tolerance  and racial equality  that would
influence later Westerns and indicate Hollywood's response to the evolving role of Native Americans in
the society of the United  States .[8] Chronicle of the Cinema praised the film: "Based on verifiable fact, it
faithfully evokes the historical relationship between Cochise and Jeffords, marking a historical
rehabilitation of Indians in the cinema ".[9]Production
Portrayal of Native AmericansIn 1950, Rosebud Yellow Robe , a Native American  folklorist, educator , and author , was hired by 20th
Century Fox to underta ke a national tour to promote  the film. Yellow Robe explained that there were no
such things as Nativ e American princesses, and that the myth started when Pocahontas  went  to England
and the English named her "Lady Rebecca". Yellow Robe voiced complaints about the portrayals of
Indians on radio, screen, and television to "a new generation of children learning the old stereotypes
about whooping, warring Indians, as if there weren't anything else interesting about us".[10]
The Apache Wedding Prayer was written for this film.[11]
