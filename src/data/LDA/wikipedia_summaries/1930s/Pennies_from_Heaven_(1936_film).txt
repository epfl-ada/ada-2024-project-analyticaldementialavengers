Pennies from Heaven (1936 film)
Pennies From Heaven  is a 1936 America n musical
comedy film directed by Norman Z. McLeod  and
starring Bing Crosby , Madge Evans , and Edith
Fellows .[1]
Jo Swerling's  screenplay was based on the novel The
Peacock Feather  by Leslie Moore. The film is about a
singer wrongly imprisoned who promises a condemned
fellow inmate that he will help the family of his victim
when he is released. The singer delays his dream of
becoming a gondolier in Venice and becomes a street
singer in order to help the young girl and her elderly
grandfather . His life is further compli cated when he
meets a beautiful welfare worker who takes a dim view
of the young girl's welfare and initiates proceedings to
have her put in an orphanage.
Pennies From Heaven remains most noteworthy for
Crosby's introduction of the titular song, a Depression -
era favorite, since recorded by numerous singers. The
film features Louis Armstrong  in a supporting role. In
1937, the film received an Oscar  nomination for Best
Original Song ( Arthur Johnston  and Johnny Burke ).[2]
This was Crosby's first independent production jointly
with Emanuel Cohen 's Major Pictures and he had a
share in the profits.[3] The film was distributed by
Columbia Pictures .
In prison, Larry Poole, a self-described troubadour , is
approached by an inmate named Hart who is on his
way to the electric chair . Hart asks Larry to deliver a
letter to a family called Smith near Middletown, New
Jersey . After finding the family , which consists of a
grandfather and a young girl named Patsy , Poole tells
them that the letter holds a key, reveals that the

Language Englishfather and that he is giving the Smith family his old
house and former hideout, the only thing he has to give
as atonement.
Susan Sprague represents the county welfare
department and it is her job to see that Patsy is raised
"properly", or the girl will go to an orphanage. A
variety of misadvent ures befall Larry as he tries to help
"Gramps" out with Patsy to save her from the orphanage, all while Susan and he are falling in love.
To get cash for a restaurant license, Larry gets a stunt job at the circus, but is injured. While he is in the
hospital, Gramps comes to let him know that the county has taken Patsy away . Larry believes Susan went
behind his back and had Patsy placed in the orphanage. It is discovered that Susan had no part in it, but
she loses her job defending Larry and his care of the child.
Larry has the circus perform for the children so that he can "break Patsy out", when Patsy lets Larry know
how Susan feels about him. Their attempt to free Patsy fails. Afterwards, Larry  finds out that Susan has
gone to New York and he goes there to find her .
While in New York, Susan is approached by two policemen looking for Larry , not to arrest him as she
suspects, but to bring him back to the head of the County Welfare Department to help deal with Patsy ,
who has gone on a hunger strike. The policemen are watching Susan's apartme nt in the hopes that Larry
will show up. When  he does, they make him leave with them, after he and Susa n reveal their feelings for
each other .
When they return to the orphanage, the head of the welfare department begs Larry to help them with
Patsy . Larry agrees to adopt Patsy and raise her with the help of Susan, who agrees to marry him and be a
mother to Patsy .

Hollywood release (Paul Robe son had been billed fourth in that same year's Show Boat), special billing
was given to Armstrong at the insistence of Bing Crosby , who also insisted on Armstrong's being hired
for the movie.
Frank S. Nugent  of The New York Times commented, "Conceding that Mr. Crosby is as good-natured as
ever and that Miss Evans is so attractiv e a social worker that we are tempted to apply for relief and be
investigated, the chief honors properly belong to little Miss Fellows. Hers really is an exceptional
performance for a youngster , skirting the perils of bathos in her tender scenes and playing her rebellious
ones with comic impertinence. Mr. Meek as the grandfather , Nana Bryant as the harried superintendent of
an orphanage and William Stack as a welfare commissioner are excellent in the supporting rôles. In sum,
"Pennies from Heaven" is one of Mr . Crosby's best."[5]
Variety  wrote, "Pennies from Heaven  may qualify as a fair grosser becaus e of Crosby's name, but
basically it's a weak  picture with a story that has little movement and only a scattered few mild giggles.
It's spread  pretty thin over 80 minutes, despite a good tuneful score which should be no handicap… Film
won't advance Crosby although Cros by may overcome its faults to some extent. Best individual
impression is by Louis Armstrong, Negro cornetist and hi-de-ho expert. Not as an eccentric musician, but
as a Negro  comedia n he suggests possib ilities. He toots his solo horn to a nice individual score, plus his
band chores. Crosby has a couple of songs that will be reprised into fair popularity ..."[6]
