Rynox
Rynox  is a 1932 British crime film directed by Michael
Powell  and starring Stewart Rome, John Long den and
Dorothy Boyd . Rynox  was adapted from a 1930 novel
by popular thriller writer of the day Philip MacDonald .
It was made at Walton Studios outside London and was
a second feature .
For many years Rynox  was believed to be among the
lost films  of Powell's 1931–1 936 quota quickie  period;
however an original print was found in 1990 in the
vaults of Pinewood Studios  and was subsequently
transferred and restored by the BFI National Archive .
Wealthy businessman F.X. Benedik (Rome), head of
the Rynox  company , claims to have been receiving
threats from a mysterious stranger named Boswell
Marsh. Benedik is subsequently found murdered and
the hunt is on for the elusive Marsh.
Benedik's son Tony (Longden) takes over the running
of the business and tries to find some lead on Marsh,
and why he should have borne a murderous grudge
against Benedik Senior . But a would-be blackmailer
reveals that Marsh never existed.
After discovering that he was terminally ill, his father
had committed suicide, having staged  the elaborate
deception about the non-existent Marsh in an attempt
to cover the fact that he intended to take his own life,
which would have voided the life insurance payout that rescues R ynox.

Although shot on a tight budget (Powell's own recollections varied between £4,500 and £8,000)[1] Rynox
was exceptionally well received by contemporary critics. Writing in The Observer , noted critic C. A.
Lejeune  presc iently remarked: "Powell's Rynox  shows what a good movie brain can do... this is the sort of
pressure under which a real talent is shot red-hot into the world." Docume ntary film pioneer John
Grierson  declared the film "as good as Hollywood" and that "there never was an Engl ish film so well-
made". A 21st-cent ury assessment by Sergio Angelini of the British Film Institute  states: "Powell's
direction already shows his characteristic energy and visual imagination, as well as his debt to the
German Expressionist cinema of the 1920s. Rynox  is full of quick cuts, tracking shots, unusual angles as
well as montages, all of which help ef fectively to draw attention away from ...the film's small budget."[2]
