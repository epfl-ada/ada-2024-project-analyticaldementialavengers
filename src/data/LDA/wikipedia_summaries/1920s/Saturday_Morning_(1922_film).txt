Saturday Morning (1922 film)
Saturday Morning  is the fifth Our Gang  short subject
comedy to be released. The Our Gang  series (later
known as "The Little Rascals") was created by Hal
Roach  in 1922, and continued production until 1944.[1]
The variou s boys of the gang each manage to escape
their responsibilities for the day, meeting up to build a
raft for their pirate game.
When the television rights for the original silent Pathé
Our Gang  comedies were sold to National Telepix and
other distributors, several episodes were retitled. This
film was released into television syndication as
"Mischief Makers" in 1960 under the title Music
Lesson . About two-thirds of the original film was
included. Most of scenes from the first half of the film
that showed the various gang members at home were
cut; all of the origi nal inter-titles were also cut. The
film was also released for home viewing as "Hooray
for Holidays".
