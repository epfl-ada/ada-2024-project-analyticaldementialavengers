soldier Juan Ricardo is assigned to obtain evidence
against Pedro the Fox, an old smuggler . His
acquaintance with Pedro's wife Guerita ripens into
mutual love. When Guerita and Juan are about to
depart, her elderly husband approac hes under the
pretense of giving her a farewell kiss, but instead stabs
and kills her. Pedro  then falls dead from the reactive
shock of his own deed. Juan is then arrested and
