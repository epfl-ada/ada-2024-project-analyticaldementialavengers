Budget $40 million[3]
Box office $224.9 million[3]The Social Network  has maintained a strong reputation
since its initial release, and is commonly ranked by
critics as one of the best films of the 2010s and 21st
century .[5][6][7][8] The Writers Guild of America  ranked
Sorkin's screenplay the third greatest of the 21st
century .[9] The factual accur acy is however largely
contested.[10] In 2024 , the film was selected for
preservation in the United States National Film
Registry  by the Library of Congress  as being
"culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant".[11]
While no official sequel has been announced, Sorkin
has publicly expressed interest and willingness to write
a screenplay for one should Fincher return to direct.[12]
On October 28, 2003, 19-year -old Harvard University
sophomore Mark Zuckerber g is dumped by his
girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm,
Zuckerber g writes an insulting post about Albright on his LiveJournal  blog. He creates a campus website
called Facemash  by hacking and downloading photos of female students from house face book s, then
allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's
computer network, Zuckerber g is given six months of academic probation .
Facemash’ s popularity attracts the attention of twins Cameron  and Tyler Winklevoss  and their business
partner Divya Narendra . The trio invites Zuckerber g to work on Harvard Connection , a social network
exclusive to Harvard students and aime d at dating. Zuckerber g approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin
with an idea for Thefacebook, a social networking  website that would be exclusive to Ivy League
students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerber g to build the website, which
quickly becomes popular . When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss  twins and Narendra are
incensed, believing that Zuckerber g stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the
Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard Presiden t Larry Summers , who is
dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on Thefacebook or Zuckerber g.
Saverin and Zuckerber g meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to "Facebook me," which
impresses them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity , Zuckerber g expands the network to Yale,
Columbia , and Stanford . Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerber g to meet Napster  co-founder Sean
Parker , who presents a "billion-dollar" vision  for the company . Zuckerber g is impressed, but Saverin
dismisses him as paranoid and delusiona l. Parker also suggests dropping "the" in Thefacebook and simply
renaming the site to Facebook .
Later , Zuckerber g relocates the company to Palo Alto, based on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New
York to work on business development. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerber g is using as a
base of operations and becomes more involved with the company , much to Saverin's annoyance.Plot(L to R) Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield (both pictured in 2023), and Justin Timberlake (2016)After narrowly losing in the 2004 Henley Royal Regatta  for Harvard against  the Hollandia Roeiclub , the
Winklevoss twins discover that Faceboo k has expanded to Europe with Oxford , Cambridge  and LSE, and
decide to sue the company for intellectual property  theft. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making
business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He
relents when Zuckerber g reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor  Peter Thiel .
After traveling to the company's new headquarters on the pretense of attendin g a business meeting and
"millionth user party ," Saverin becomes  enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows
his share of Facebook to be diluted  from  34% to 0.03%, without diluting the ownership percentage of any
other owner. He confronts Zuckerber g and Parker , and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerber g. Saverin's name
had already been removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO; Parke r tells him that he is no
longer a part of Facebook and has security eject him from the building.
Later , Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users.
He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerber g cuts ties with him, telling him to go home.
In separate depositions , the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerber g stole their idea, while Saverin claims
his shares  of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy , a
junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerber g that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid
details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerber g's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury.
Alone, Zuckerber g sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.

Josh Pence  is the body double for Hammer , whose likeness was digitally imposed onto Pence's body . He
is listed in the end credits as playing Tyler Winklevoss alongside Hammer , though he also shot scenes as
Cameron. He also appears in a cameo role as the man being detoured from the bathroom by Zuckerber g
and Saverin.[26]
Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin  said, "What attrac ted me to [the film project] had nothing to do with
Facebook . The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of
friendship, loyalty , jealousy , class and power ." He said he read an unfinished draft of The Accidental
Billionair es when the publisher  began "shopping it around" for a film adaptation. Sorkin added, "I was
reading it and somew here on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything ... They wanted
me to start right away . Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel
lines."[27] In August 2008 Sorkin started a Faceb ook group for research purposes while he was working
on the film. "I've just agreed to write a movie for Sony and producer Scott Rudin about how Faceboo k
was inven ted. I figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what Facebook is, so I've
started this page."[28][29] He empha sized the role of the competing narratives at a Q&A  screening hosted
by Myspace : "If the same story was behind the invention of MySpace or Friendster , I would  have written
that. Two separate lawsuits were brought against Facebook at roughly the same time. Rather than pick
one and decide that's the truth, or pick one and say that's the sexist, I like the idea that there are three
conflicting stories."[30]
According to Sorkin, Mezrich did not send him material from his book as he wrote it: "Two or three times
we'd get together . I'd go to Boston , or we'd meet in New York and kind of compare notes and share
information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it. By the time I saw the book, I was
probably 80 percent done with the screenplay ."[27] Sorkin elaborated:Production
ScreenplayThere's a lot of available research, and I also did a lot of first person research with a number of
the people that were involved in the story . I can't go too deeply into that because most of the
people did it on the condition of anonymity , but what I found was that two lawsuits were
brought against Face book at roughly the same time, that the defendant, plaintif fs, witnesses all
came into a deposition room and swore under oath, and three different versio ns of the story
were told. Instead of choosing one and deciding that's the truest one or choosing one and
deciding that's the juiciest one, I decided to dramatize the idea that there were  three different
versions of the story being told. That's how I came up with the structure of the deposition
room.[27]
Casting began in mid-2009, with Jesse Eisenber g, Justin Timberlake , and Andrew Garfield  announced to
star.[31][32] Jonah Hill was in contention for Timberlake's role, but director David Fincher  passed on
him.[33] In October 2009, Brenda Song , Rooney Mara , Armie Hammer , Shelby Young , and Josh Pence
were cast.[34] Max Minghella  and Dakota Johnson  were  also confirmed.[34] In a 2009 interview  with The
Baltimor e Sun, Eisenber g said, "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character
seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I
don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you never
have to worry about the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the
furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network  is the biggest relief  I've ever had in a movie".[35] In
2010, it was announced that Rashida Jones  would appear as Marylin Delpy .[18]
Principal photograp hy bega n in October 2009 in Cambridge, Massac husetts .[36] Scen es were filme d
around the campuse s of two Massachu setts prep schools, Phillips Academy  and Milton Academy .[37]
Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Wheelock College , which was set up to be Harvard's
campus.[38] (Harvard has turned down most requests for on-location filming ever since the filming of
Love Story  (1970), which cause d significant physical damage to trees on campus.)[39] Filming took place
on the Keyser and Wyman quadrangle s in the Homewood campus  of Johns Hopkins University  from
November 2–4,[40] which also doubled for Harvard in the film.[41] The first scene in the film, where
Zuckerber g is with his girlfriend, took 99 takes to finish.[4] The film was shot on the Red One digital
cinema camera.[42] The rowin g scenes with the Winklevoss brothers were filmed at Community Rowing
Inc. in Newton, Massachusetts[43] and at the Henley Royal Regatta; miniature faking  process was used in
a sequence  showing a rowing event at the latter .[44] Although a significa nt portion of the latter half of the
film is set in Silicon Valley , the filmmakers opted to shoot those scenes in Los Angeles and Pasadena .
Armie Hammer , who portrayed the Winklevoss twins, acted alongside body double Josh Pence while his
scenes were filmed.  His face was later digitally grafted onto Pence's face during post-production, while
other scenes used split-screen photography . Pence was concerned about having no face time during the
role, but after considerable musing thought of the role as a "no-brainer". He also appears in a cameo roleCasting
FilmingHarvard's rowing tradition is
depicted in the film.elsewhere in the film.[26] Hammer states that director David Fincher "likes to push himself and likes to
push technology" and is "one of the most technologically minded guys I've ever seen."[45] This included
sending the actors to "twin boot camp" for 10 months to learn everything about the Winklevosses.[26]
Community Rowing  Inc. held a casting call and a tryout for 20
rowing extras; some  were graduates from Harvard, Northeastern
University , Boston University , Geor ge Washington University , and
Trinity College , as well as local club rowers from Union Boat
Club  and Riverside Boat Club .[46] None of the cast rowing extras
for the Henley Royal Regatta racing scene appeared in the film;
filming for the race was originally planned to take place in Los
Angeles, but Fincher decided to film in England  during
production.[47]
David Fincher hired Loyola Marymount  coach Dawn Reagan to
help train Josh Pence and Armie Ham mer.[48] While Hammer was new to the sport, Pence rowed
previously at Dartmouth College .[48]
The indoor rowing scene was filmed at Boston University's indoor rowing tanks. All of BU's blue oars in
the scene were repainted to Harvard's crimson   color for filming. Dan Boyne was the official rowing
consultant in the US and the UK.[47]
On June 1, 2010, it was announced that Trent Reznor  and Atticus Ross  would score the film.[49] The
soundtrack was released September 28 in various formats under the Null Corporation label.[50] Leading
up to the release of the soundtrack, a free five-track EP was made  available  for download.[51] The White
Stripes ' song "Ball and Biscuit " can be heard in the opening of the film and the Beatles ' song "Baby ,
You're a Rich Man" concludes the film. Neither song appears on the soundtrack album. Reznor and Ross
won the award for Best Original Score  at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards ,[52] as well as the 2011
Academy Award  for Best Original Score .
The first theatrical poster , designed by Neil Kellerhouse, was released on June 18, 2010.[53] As
Kellerhouse previou sly designed posters for the films of Steven Soderber gh, director David Fincher's
friend, he was conta cted by Ceán Chaf fin in late 2009 to work on the key art for The Social Network ,
which had to make sole use of one approved photograph, that of Eisenber g's head.[54] As he wanted to
highlight the tremendous drama that went with Mark Zuckerber g's success, Kellerhouse thought of the
tagline "You don't get to 300 million friends without making a few enemies"; he would later adjust the
line to "500 million friends" in anticipation of Facebook reaching 500 million users by the film's releaseRowing production

work for the film I'm Still Here, has since  become influential in film marketing; posters for The King's
Speech  and The Armstr ong Lie  strongly evoked the poster's design format.[55][56]
The film's first teaser trailer  was released on June 25, 2010.[57] The second teaser was released on July
8.[58] The full length theatrical trailer debuted  on July 16, 2010, which plays an edited version of the song
"Creep ", originally by Radiohead , covered by the Belgian choir group Scala & Kolacny Brothers .[59][60]
The trailer  was then shown in theaters, prior to the films Inception , Dinner for Schmuck s, Salt, Easy A,
The Virginity Hit, and The Other Guys . The theatrical trailer , put together by Mark Woollen & Associates ,
won the Grand Key Art award at the 2011 Key Art Awards ,[61] sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter ,
and was also featured on The Film Informant 's Perfect 10 Trailers in 2010.[62]
The Social Network  had its first screening at the New York Film Festival  on September 24, 2010.[1]
The film was release d in theaters in the United States on the weekend of Octobe r 1–3, 2010. It debuted at

number -one film of 2010, while being  the third-smallest overall behind Secretariat 's 25.1% drop and
Tooth Fairy's 28.6% drop. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $97 million in the United
States and $128 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $224.9 million.[3]

"universal acclaim".[64] Audiences polled by CinemaScore  gave the film an average grade of "B+"  on an
A+ to F scale.[65]
From The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars, praising David Fincher's directing as the
"right intensity and claustrophobia for a story that takes place largely in a stupefyingly male environment
at Harvard  University in 2003".[66] In her review for The Verge, Kaitlyn Tiffany wrote positive comments
on Aaron Sorkin's screenplay , writing that his "reflex for writing witty , whiny men with outsized intellect
and poorly disguised narcissism serves as an advantage instead of a handicap."[67] The film's editing by
Kirk Baxter  and Angus Wall was also lauded by critics, leading to their win of the Academy Award for
Best Film Editing .[68] Addi tionally , the film's score  received positive commentary , with some reviewers
stating that it was "a persistent source of simmering tension in the movie", and a "masterpiece".[69][70]Trailers

Box office
Critical receptionJesse Eisenberg received critical
acclaim for his performance as Mark
Zuckerberg, earning an Academy
Award nomination for Best Actor.Roger Ebert  of the Chicago Sun-T imes, giving it four stars and
naming it the best film of the year, wrote: "David Fincher's film
has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero,
but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and
instinctively percep tive."[71] Peter Travers  of Rolling Stone  gave
the film his first full four-star rating of the year and said: "The
Social Network  is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin
triumph by taking it further . Lacing their scathing wit with an
aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade."[72]
The Harvar d Crimson  review called it "flawless" and gave it five
stars.[73]
Joe Morgenstern  in The Wall Street Journal  praised the film as
exhilarating but noted: "The biographical part takes liberties with
its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on [...] The
Accidental Billionair es, so every thing that's seen isn't necessarily
to be believed."[74] Nathan Heller of Slate  wrote a negative review
of the film, describing it as "rote and deeply mediocre" as well as
"maddeningly generic", and said that, "Sorkin and Fincher's 2003
Harvard is a citadel of old money , regatta blazers, and (if I am not
misreading the implication here) a Jewish underclass striving beneath the heel of a WASP-centric,
socially draconian culture... to get the university this wrong in this movie is no small matter ."[75]
The Social Network  appe ared on 78 film critics' top-ten lists of the best films of 2010, based on
Metacritic's aggregation. Out of the critics, 22 ranked the film first, and 12 ranked the film second. Out of
the films of 2010, The Social Network  appeared on the most top-ten lists.[76][77] In 2016, The Social
Network  was voted the 27th-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as voted on by 177 film critics
from around the world.[78]
In 2018, IndieW ire writers ranked the script the fourth best American screenplay of the 21st century , with
Michael Nordine arguing that "everything came together nearly perfectly on the film, thanks in large part
to Aaron Sorkin's Oscar -winning screenplay . Its finds the loquacious scribe at his best, with all the verbal
takedowns [...] and rapid-fire back-and-f orths we've come to expect (and, more often than not, love) from
him. Sorkin's portrayal of Mark Zuckerber g was hardly flattering, but recent headlines suggest it may
have been too sympathetic."[79]
The Social Network  was released on DVD  and Blu-ray  on January 11, 2011 by Sony Pictures Home
Entertainment . In its first week of release, DVD sales totaled $13,470,305 and it was the number -one-

awards.[87] The film also won the "Hollywood Ensemble Award" from the Hollywood Film Awards .[88]
The script  was leaked  online in July 2009.[89][90] In November 2009 ,
executive producer Kevin Spacey said, "The Social Network  is probab ly
going to be a lot funnier than people  might expect it to be."[91] The
Cardinal Courier  stated that the film was about "greed, obsession,
unpredictability and sex" and asked, "Although there are over 500 million
Facebook users, does this mean Facebook can become a profitable
blockbuster movie?"[92]
At the D8 conference hosted by D: All Things Digital  on June 2, 2010,
host Kara Swisher  told Zuckerber g she knew he was not happy with The
Social Network  being based on him, to which he replied, "I just wished
that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."[93] Zuck erber g
stated to Oprah Winfrey  that the drama and partying of the film is mostly
fiction, and that he had spent most of the past six years focusing, working
hard, and coding Facebook.[94] Speaking  to an audience at Stanford
University , Zuckerb erg said that instead of making Facebook to "get
girls", he made it because he enjoyed "building things".[95] He added thatAccolades
Historical accuracythe film accurately depicted his wardrobe, saying, "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting
right—like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own."[95]
Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz  called the film a "dramatization of history ... it is interesting to
see my past rewritte n in a way that emphasizes things that didn't matter , (like the Winklevosses, who I've
still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves
out things  that really did (like the many other people in our lives at the time, who supported us in
innumerable ways)". According to Moskovitz:[96]
A lot of exciting things happened in 2004, but mostly we just worked a lot and stressed out
about things; the version in the trailer seems a lot more exciting, so I'm just going to choose to
remember that we drank ourselves silly and had a lot of sex with coeds. ... The plot of the
book/script unabashedly attacked [Zuc kerber g], but I actually felt like a lot of his positive
qualities come out truthfully in the trailer (soundtrack aside). At the end of the day, they cannot
help but portray him as the driven, forward-thinking genius that he is.
Co-founder Eduardo Saverin said "the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-
based documentary".[97] Sean Parker described the film and its depiction of him as "a morally
reprehensible human being" as "a complete work of fiction,", and claimed that he remained friends with
Saverin.[98][99] Sorkin said, "I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling.
What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy
of the good?"[4]
Journalist Jeff Jarvis  acknowledged the film was "well-crafted" but called it "the anti-social movie",
objecting to Sorkin's  decision to change various events and characters for drama tic effect, and dismissing
it as "the story that those who resist the change society is under going want to see".[100] Technology
broadcaster Leo Laporte  conc urred, calling the film "anti-geek and misogynistic ".[101] Sork in responded
to these allegations by saying, "I was writing about a very angry and deeply misogynistic group of
people".[102]
Andrew Clark of The Guardian wrote that "there's something insidious  about this genre of [docudrama]
scriptwriting", wondering if "a 26-yea r-old businessman really deserves to have his name dragged
through the mud in a murky mixture of fact and imagination for the general entertainment of the movie-
viewing public?". Clark added, "I'm not sure whether Mark Zuckerber g is a punk, a genius or both. But I
won't be seeing The Social Network  to find out."[103]
Mashable  founder and CEO  Pete Cashmore , blogging for CNN , said: "If the Facebook founder
[Zuckerber g] is concerned about being  represented as anything but a genius with an industrious work
ethic, he can breathe a sigh of relief."[104] Jessi Hempel, a technology writer for Fortune  who says she
has known Zuckerber g "for a long time", wrote of the film:
The real-life Zuckerber g was maniacall y focused on building a web site that could potentially
connect everyone on the planet...By contrast, in the film he seems more obsessed with
achieving the largesse that bad boy Sean Parker , an original Napster founder , portrays when he
arrives to meet Zuckerber g at a New York restaurant.[105]Harvard Law Schoo l professor Lawrence Lessig  wrote in The New Republic  that Sorkin's screenplay does
not acknowledge the "real villain" of the story:
The total and absolute absurdity of the world where the engines of a federal lawsuit get cranked
up to adjudicate the hurt feelings (because "our idea was stolen!") of entitled Harvard
under graduates is completely missed by Sorkin. We can't know enough from the film to know
whether there was actually any substant ial legal claim here. Sorkin has been upfront about the
fact that there are fabrications aplenty lacing the story . But from the story as told, we certainly
know enough to know that any legal system that would allow these kids to extort $65 million
from the most successful business this century should be ashamed of itself. Did Zuckerber g
breach his contract? Maybe, for which the damages are more like $650, not $65 million. Did he
steal a trade secret? Absolutely not. Did he steal any other "property"? Absolutely not—the
code for Facebook was his, and the "idea" of a social network is not a patent. It wasn't justice
that gave the twins $65 million; it was the fear of a random and inefficient system of law. That
system is a tax on innovation and creativity . That tax is the real villain here, not the innovator it
burdened.[106]
In an onstage discu ssion with the Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington  in 2010, Facebook 's
chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said the film was "very Hollywood" and mainly "fiction". She
said that "in real life, [Zuckerber g] was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer ,
ordering pizza. Who wants to go see that for two hours?".[107] HarvardConnection  co-founder Divya
Narendra  said that he was surprised to see himself portrayed by the non-Indian actor Max Minghella, but
said he did a "good job in pushing the dialogue forward and creating a sense of urgency in what was a
very frustrating period".[108]
Since its release, The Socia l Network  has inspired involvement in start-ups and social media.[109] Bob
Lefsetz  has stated that: "watching this movie makes you want to run from the theatre , grab your laptop
and build your own empire,"[110] noting that The Socia l Network  has helped fuel an emerging perception
that "techies have become the new rock stars."[111] This has led Dave Knox to comment that: "fifteen
years from  now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of
entrepreneurs."[110] After seeing the movie, Zuckerber g was quoted as saying he is "interested to see what
effect The Social Network  has on entrepreneu rship", noting that he gets "lots of messages from people
who claim that they have been very much inspired... to start their own comp any."[112] Saverin echoed
these senti ments, stating that the film may inspire "countless others to create and take that leap to start a
new business."[113] In one such instan ce, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate  confirmed that they
were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network .[114]Legacy
Preliminary impactFollowing his success with the film, Sorkin became attached to another project about a technology
company , writing the script for the 2015 biopic Steve Jobs, which used a similar format.[115] Another
Facebook film may be produced, as Sheryl Sandber g has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment
to develop her 2013 book Lean In: W omen, W ork and the W ill to Lead , into a movie.[116]
Following the close of the decade, The Social Network  was recognized as one of the best films of the
2010s. Metacritic  reported that it was listed on over 30 film critics' top-ten lists for the 2010s, including
eight first-place rankings and four second-place rankings. Metacritic ranked The Social Network  third
overall, following Mad Max:  Fury Road  and Moonlight .[117] Esquir e named The Socia l Network  the best
of the 2010s, callin g it Citizen Kane  "for the Internet age" and dubbing it "the movie of our new
millennium".[118] With Facebook going "from a utopian, world-shrinking force of good to a potential
threat to democracy", Esquir e wrote, "Fincher seemed to sense all of this and more long before anyone
else. And his brilliant, troubling film bristles with that queasy sense of prophecy and prescience."[118]
Polygon , calling The Social Network  the best film of the decade, wrote, "The Social Network , by chance
or by design, has become one of the most immensely relevant movies of this decade... But after nearly a
decade of watching Facebook 'move fast and break things,' including news websites, social video,
politics, etc., the movie's tangible sense of tension can easily be reinterpreted as foreboding for what
comes after  you make a billion friends."[119] Director Quentin Tarantino  called the film the best of the
2010s, singling out the script by Sorkin, whom he described as "the greatest active dialogist".[120]
Rolling Stone  ranked The Social Network  second after Moonlight  (2016) on its end-of-decade list,
describing it as "one deliciously re-watchable preview of the apocalypse, as entertaining and cheeky as it
is troubling and startlingly prescient".[121] Time Out named it the fourth-best of the decade, "Powered by
a relentles s, clinical Aaron Sorkin scrip t, directed with sinuous grace by David Fincher and loaded with
smirking, smart-ass  central performances, The Social Network  is arguab ly the most important and
prophetic film of our era, itself a depressing thought."[122] ScreenCrush  ranked The Social Network
eighth, referring to it as "[Fincher's] spiritual sequel to Fight Club , another story of an embittered, lonely
man who discovers unleashing his rage at society has unexpected consequences".[123] Mashable , listing
The Social Network  among the top 15 films of the 2010s, said of the story , "It was everything young
people could be and everything older generations feared in us before a decade of blaming [us for]
problems we didn't create and can't solve."[124] IndieW ire ranked The Social Network  sixteenth among
the decade's films, writing, "The Social Network  is both a thrilling, queasy exploration of how Facebook
came to be and a searing indictment of what it would inevitably become."[125] Inverse  listed the film
among those defining "class rage" in the 2010s, "As a gently prodding diagnosis of class conflict, The
Social Network  is a logical place to start."[126]
In 2024, Looper  ranked it number 5 on its list of the "51 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time," writing
"Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's examination of Facebook's ascension in power and how that
came at the cost of so many people's well-being and relationships has only gotten more prescient as the
years have passed by. Plus, performances as good as the ones delivered here by Jesse Eisenber g and
Andrew Garfield never go out of style."[127]Post-2010s assessment
Possible sequelIn January 2019, Sorkin revealed that Rudin has suggested the development of a screenplay for a sequel,
noting, "A lot of very interesting, dramatic stuff has happened since the movie ends."[128] Sork in also
mentioned that there was indeed enough material to create a sequel.[129] On July 18, 2019, Eisenber g
expressed his interests in starring in the proposed sequel, stating that "Sork in is a genius, and if he
chooses to write about something, I'll obviously be interested".[130] In Octobe r 2020, a decade after the
film's release, Sorkin announced that he would only write the sequel's script if Fincher returned as
director .[131] In 2023, Fincher told The Guar dian that he and Sorkin have discussed a sequel, but said
"that's a can of worms."[132] On April 26, 2024, Sorkin said he had been working on the script for a new
Facebook movie tied to the January 6 United States Capitol attack .[133]
