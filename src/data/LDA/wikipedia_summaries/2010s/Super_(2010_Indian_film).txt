Super (2010 Indian film)
Super  (pronoun ced Super , originall y known only by
the Vitarka Mudrā  hand symbol) is a 2010 Indian
Kannada -language political drama  film written and
directed by Upendra .[2] The film was released on 3
December 2010 in its Kannada  version, and on 11
March 2011 in its Telugu  version, which had a few
scenes reshot with Ali and Sadhu Kokila  switching
roles.[3] This utopian  film has a concept of a
contrasting futuristic India set in the year 2030, and the
contemporary image of India.[4]
The film revolves around Subash, an NRI (Non-
resident Indian)  who is challenged by his fiancée who
has a modern outlook, to change India. The film shows
Subash trying to bring change to India. The film
generated large amounts of coverage in media, as it
marked the end of Upendra's ten-year hiatus from
directing. The film received positive critical acclaim,
with critics praising the concept and screenplay .
With the title of the film depicted only by a symbol, its
stars Upendra  and Nayanthara  and is produced by
Rockline Venkatesh , while V. Harikrishna  scored the
music.[5]
Subash Chandra Gandhi (Upendra ) resides in London
and owns the multi-billion dollar compa ny Gandhi and
Gandhi. He falls in love with Indira  (Nayanthara );
because he hopes that she is a traditional girl. Indira,
however , is on a mission to kill Gandhi–he is
responsible for her older sister falling into a coma.
After Indir a left him, she gives Gandhi the challenge to
remain an ordinary citizen in India, disclosing her
mission. Gandhi goes to Bangalore to attempt her
challenge but fails miserably . Societal attitudes deeplyPlotBuddha statue

gesture.disturbed him, and when his father reaches Bangalore from London to take him back, Gandhi makes the
decision to continue residing in India and change the fortune of the common man.
Around this time, Indira, now also in India, hatches a plot to kill Gandhi. With 10 million pounds from
his father in India, Gandhi starts a multinational company of Rowdies, subsequently becoming the chief
minister of the state.
After becoming the chief minister , Gandhi rapes Indira, while an Indian state gets auctioned of f.

Upendra returned to direction after nearly ten years. The nameless film was
originally represente d only by the hand symbol (seen in posters) and Upendra
wanted the audience to name the film. The hand symbol could mean zero, or
three or the Om symbol or Vitarka Mudrā  (an ancie nt Buddhist  gesture), public
and media stuck to calling it Super .[8]
Shooting began on 18 February 2010 at the Kanteerava Indoor Stadium with the
planned schedule for 90 days which included various locations in Bengaluru ,
Dubai  and London .[9] It was produced by Rockline Venkatesh under the banner
Rockline Production s, which is its 25th venture. The film saw the debut of Tamil-
Malayalam actress Nayanthara in Kannada films. Being a multilingual film,
several artists from Telugu and Tamil film industries like Ali, Kadal Dandapan i,
Jeeva are also featured.[10]
Prior to release, much information about the film was kept under wraps. During  the promotion of the film
at an interview on a radio station, Upendra expressed his disappointment being labeled as a "different
director" and explained that most of his directorial ventures deal with the things  that he had under gone in
his real life.[11] When asked about the ten-year break,  Upendra said he thought he would work on hisCast

Producer V. Harikrishnaacting career, but then it sucked him in like a vacuum which he could not get out of. After reaching a
point where he was afraid he had lost his ability to direct films, he had to fight his fear and that is when
he started working on the script of Super .[12]
A symbol being the title of the film, it is replete with symbolism from the title sequence  is displayed.[13]
Uppi has made the movie Super that is named after hand symbol completely  a different film and that
different trick starts right from the displaying title cards, which has never been attempted by anyone in
Indian cinema. For instance, the credit for direction just shows "U" with an index finger pointing towards
the audience. This story of India is narrated metaphorically  through the story of Indira, the female
lead.[14]
Super  depicts a Utopian  India in the year 2030 where Indians are pictured to be wealthy , hard-working,
and are seen wearing traditional clothing  consisting of Ilkal saree  and panche . In contrast, westerners  are
the ones taking care of menial jobs like taxi driving, janitorial, etc. It is a future where the Indian rupee  is
worth 70 times the pound sterling  and people who cannot speak Kannada  are considered illiterates (and
Westerners are visibly apologetic about the same). From this setting, the film regresses back to the current
year 2010  where India is beset with problems of corruption, red-tapism , pollution and unem ployment.
Political satire is played out by using sounds of horses and donkeys when ministers appear on the screen,
which represents the political horse trading  witnessed in recent times in the state of Karnataka .[15] Scen es
of raping Indira and the auctioning process of an entire Indian state are inters persed to draw a parallel
between the two.[16] The film finds a climax back in 2030 where a foreigner asks an Indian as to who was
responsible for all the good changes in India, and the film ends abruptly again with the index finger
pointing at the audience, symbolizing that it's the people who are ultimately responsible for the course of
a nation.
The Super  soun dtrack album rights was acquired  by
Madhu Bangarappa of Akash Audio for a record price
of ₹12.5 millio n.[17] Compose d by V Harikrishna, the
album has five songs and Upendra has penned lyrics
for three and remaining two have been written by
Yograj Bhat  and V Manohar . It was officially released
on 19 November at Leela Palace by Puneeth Rajkumar
and Raghavendra Rajkumar .[18]
Unlicensed  copies of the album were available online within hours after the release, and a team was
formed by the production unit to fight audio infringement. This resulted in some  Kannada music websites
being brought down permanently .[19][20]

Venkatesh. The film saw a special screening in Infosys  at its Mysore  campus. It was also screened at the
fourth Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFF) in December 2011 as part of the 'political satire'

Telugunewspapers like Eenadu  and Vaartha  which described Super  as 'Upendra's best creative attempt'  and was
reported to be doing  well in Andhra Pradesh. Reviews on the websites were also quite positive about the
film.  According  to Upendra, the film's good reviews boosted the collections and that the film as a whole
has been appreciated and the fresh concept of the story has been widely discussed in media.  The
distributors were quite happy about the response received throughout Andhra Pradesh.[35] Acco rding to
the box office analy sts of Andhra Prade sh, the film surprisingly caught the attention of the B, C centre
audience in a big way and scored good success.[36]
Critically , the film was widely well received with the Times of India  rating it 4/5 stars and describing that
the film "succeeds in keeping the audien ce entertained with witty dialogs, neat script and lively narration,
along with Upendra's antics, and, at times, his strange make-up."[37] Deccan Herald  termed the film as
"something extraord inary" and praised Upendra's grand return to the direction "by confusing and exciting
the audience right from the movie’ s inception, with a hotchpotch of his trademark films and roles" while
downplaying the characterization of heroines.[38]
Sify calle d it a "revolutionary concept" in story-telling which "will make people ponder over the
contemporary events and see how the country is plundered by the greedy politicians and corporate
community ."[4] DNA  India  also rated it 4/5 stars with a consensus that "Upendra still has all it takes to
churn movies that are 'his style,' but contemporary in nature and he puts forth a message through this film
as well, as he ruthlessly mocks the current political scenario."[39] Other reviewers have largely
appreciated the multifaceted film for its technicality , complex script dished out in an out-of-the-box
narratorial techniqu e while keeping the commercial aspect intact.[40][41] Performances of all artists,
especially Upendra's, has been another highlighted feature of the film.[42]
In 2011, Rajinikanth  attended a private screening of Super  arranged by the producer Rockline Venkatesh.
"It all started a couple of months ago when I met Rajini sir and told him abou t the film I was going to
produce with Uppi as director . When he heard the story of the film, he was very happy ," said Rockline.
"When he learnt that it was a hit, he was thrilled and asked me to hold a screeni ng for him, too."[43] After
the screening, Rajinikanth commented: "I like watching Upendra's films and this was no exception. He is
an excellent director and is one of a kind in the country . The kind of subject he has chosen is excellent.
We need more films of this kind which are thought-provoking and also well-made. It's amazing that a
film of this scale has been made in Kannada. If I get an opportunity and an impressive script, I'd like to
do a Kannada film in the future."[43]Critical reception
Special scr eeningsThe film saw a special screening in Infosys  at its Mysore  campus where thousands of employees, which
included non-Kannadigas, watched the film.[44] It was screened at the fourth Bangalore International
