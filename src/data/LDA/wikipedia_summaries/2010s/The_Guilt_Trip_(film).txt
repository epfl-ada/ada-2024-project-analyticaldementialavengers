Andy Brew ster, going on a cross-country trip to try to
sell the non-toxic cleaning product he developed,
invites his mother to join him. Unbeknownst to her, he
wants them to meet an old flame of hers.
The film was released on December 19, 2012, received
mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $41 million on
a production budget of $40 million.
Andy Brewster is a UCLA -graduate organic chemist
and inventor . He wants to get his environmentally
friendly cleaning product, ScieoClean, in a major retail
store. However his sales pitches fall on deaf ears.
He visits his mother , Joyce Brewster , in New Jersey
before leaving on a cross-country trip to Las Vegas,
lying that a pitch to K-Mart went well so she will not
worry .
While there, she reveals that he was named after
Andrew Margolis, a boy she fell in love with in
Florida, who she hoped would object to her marriage
with Andy's father . However , he did not, making her
feel she had never  mattered to him. After a little
research, he finds Andrew Margolis is alive, unmarried
and living in San Francisco . He invites his unknowing
mother on the trip, saying he wants to spend some time
with her .
The road trip quickly becomes hard for Andy as his
mother meddles in his life. After their car breaks down
in Tennessee , Joyce calls Andy's ex-girlfriend Jessica,
whom she insists he should get back together with, toPlotBudget $40 million[4]
Box office $41.9 million[4]pick them up. At a pregnant and married Jessica's
house, she reveals that Andy proposed to her before
college, and she turned him down, shocking Joyce.
Andy is glum afterw ard, and Joyce apologizes for calling Jessica, which he half-heartedly accepts. In
Texas, he meets  with Costco  executive Ryan McFee. Joyce stays at the meeting, criticizing the product's
labeling and name along with Ryan until Andy snaps at him. At a motel that night, a depressed Andy
begins drinking, and Joyce attempts to make up with him. He gets angry , only to have her snap back and
leave for a bar. Later, Andy attempts to retrieve Joyce and gets in a fight with a bar patron over her,
receiving a black eye in the process.
At a steak  restaurant the next day, the two exchange apologies, and Andy reveals that he is failing at
selling ScieoClean. Joyce enters a steak-eating challenge and is noticed by cowboy-businessman Ben
Graw , who gives her tips to help her finish the challenge.
Afterwards, Ben reveals he does busine ss in New Jersey and asks her to dinner . Joyce, who has not been
in a relationship since Andy's dad died years before, balks at the offer, so Ben merely leaves his number
and asks her to call if she reconsiders.
Andy and Joyce begin to genuinely enjoy each other's company after, taking time to visit the Grand
Canyon  (which Joyce has always wanted to see) and having other adventures.
In Las Vegas, Joyce has such a good time that she suggests Andy leave her while he visits San Francisco,
forcing him to reveal that he chose the city so she could meet Andrew Margolis. Joyce is very distraught,
having believed Andy solely invited her to spend time with her .
Andy makes his pitch at the Home Shopping Network  but finds that his science-based pitch bores the
executives. Seeing Joyce, he takes her advice by talking about family safety , and drinking a large amount
of it to prove his product will not harm children. The CEO shows genuine interest in selling ScieoClean
on the Network. Jubilant, Andy and Joyce decide to visit Andrew Mar golis's house.
When they arrive, they meet Andrew's son, Andrew Margolis Jr., whom Andy mistook for the father . He
reveals that his father died five years ago. Seeing Joyce's grief, he invites them inside. She asks if
Andrew's father ever mentioned her, but he says he never did as he only confide d personal information to
their mother , who is in Florida.
Andrew then introduces his sister , who is also named Joyce. Joyce is overjoyed, believing that you name
your child ren after someone you cherished and want to remember . This makes her believe that she
mattered to Andrew .
Afterwards, they part ways at the San Francisco Airport : Andy to make his next sales pitch and Joyce
back to New Jersey , where she arranges a date with Ben Graw . The two leave  content and much closer
than they had been.
