Tomatoes  based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.[6]
Judith Matloff, a veteran  foreign correspondent and contributing editor at Columbia Journalism  Review[7]
said that the film was "the latest Hollywood production to get the role of the conflict correspondent
wrong".[8] Matl off wrote: "But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were
also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record
history . This doesn't particularly come through in the film. Instead, Silver plays to the Hollywood
stereotype of journalists as heartless outsiders. After a fun day taking pictures of black people massacring
each other , the lads go back to the white suburbs and party — the implication being that the bloodshed is
a game to them."[8] Matlof f worked with Marinovich and knew Silva, as she was a member of the
Johannesbur g press corps in the early 1990s. She wrote that Marinovich had disassociated himself from
the film version. "It has the same title but it is not the same story . It's not my life. I don't see the character
as me."[8]
In The Guardian, Miriam Brent said "Frustratingly , though, while the film poses pertinent questions
about when to put the camera down, it shies away from delving deeper into these moral dilemmas and the
emotional strain faced by combat photographers. Instead we're introduced to a testosterone-fuelled world
in which dodging bullets is just anothe r way of getting kicks before the partying starts. … It's just a
shame the accomplished cinematograp hy isn't matched by a script that lets the true bravery and
accomplishments of combat photojournalists shine through, as they deserve."[9]
