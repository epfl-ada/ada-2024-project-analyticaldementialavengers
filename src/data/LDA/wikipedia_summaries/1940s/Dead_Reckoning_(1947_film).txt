Dead Reckoning (1947 film)
Dead Reckoning  is a 1947[i] American film noir
directed by John Cromwell  and starring Humphrey
Bogart , Lizabeth Scott, Morris Carnovsky , and William
Prince . It was written by Steve Fisher  and Oliver H.P.
Garrett , based on a story by Gerald Drayson Adams
and Sidney Biddell, adapted by Allen Rivkin .[1] Its plot
follows a war hero, Warren Murdock (Bogart) who
begins investigating the death of his friend and fellow
soldier , Johnny Drak e (Prince). The investigation leads
Murdock to his frien d's mistress, a mysterious woman
whose husband Drake was accused of murdering.
The film was originally intended to star Rita Hayworth
in Scott's role as a followup to Columbia Pictures 's
successful Gilda  (1946), but she refused the role over a
contract dispute. Instead, Scott was loaned out from
her contract with Paramount Pictures  to co-star with
Bogart, who himself  was loaned out for the project by
Warner Bros.  Filming took place in the summer of
1946, largely on Columbia sounds tages in Los
Angeles, with location shoots occurring in St.
Petersbur g, Florida ; Biloxi, Mississippi ; Philadelphia ,
and New York City .
Dead Reckoning  was first released theatrically in San
Francisco  on New Year's Eve 1946 , expanding to a
wide theatrical release in January 1947. The film
received mixed reviews at the time of its release.[8]
Leaving a church, Father Logan, a well-known ex-
paratrooper padre, is approached by Captain "Rip"
Murdock. Murdock needs to tell someone what has
happened to him in the past few days in case his
enemies get to him. A flashback  follows:

Language Englishawarded the Medal of Honor  (and Murdock the
Distinguished Service Cross ), he disappears before
newspaper photographers can take his picture.
Murdock goes AWOL , follows the clues and tracks his
friend to Gulf City in the southern United States ,
where he learns Drake is dead – his burned corpse is
recovered from a car crash.
Murdock finds out that Drake joined the Army under
an assumed name to avoid a murder charge. He was
accused of killing a rich old man named Chandler because Drake was in love with Chandler's beautiful
young wife Coral.
Murdock goes to a nightclub to question Louis Ord, a witness at Drake’ s trial for Chandler's murder . Ord
reveals that Drake had given him a letter to give to Murdock. Murdock also meets Coral and Martinelli,
the club owner . Seeing Coral losing heavily at roulette , Murdock not only recoups her losses at craps , but
also wins her an additional $16,000. For some reason, however , she is uncomfortable with the situation.
When all three go to collect the money in Martinelli's private office, Murdock accepts a drink even
though he is tipped off by Ord that the drink is drugged. When Murdock awakens the next morning, he
finds Ord's dead body planted in his hotel room. He manages to hide the corpse  before police Lieutenant
Kincaid, responding to an anonymous tip, shows up to search his room without a warrant.
Murdock teams up with Coral. Suspecting that Martinelli had Ord killed in order to get Drake’ s letter ,
Murdock breaks into Martinelli's office, only to find the safe already open. Just before he is knocked
unconscious again, this time by an unseen assailant, he smells jasmine, the same aroma as Coral's
perfume. When he awakes, Martinelli has him roughed up by his thug Krause, to try to find out the
content of the messa ge encoded in the letter . However , Murdock is able to escape from his captors when
taking him back to his hotel; the police arrive. The flashback ends, and Murdock slips away .
Now suspicious of Coral, Murdock goes to her apartment to confront her. She claims to be innocent, but
finally admits that she shot her husband in self-defence, not Drake. She went to Martinelli for advice and
gave him the murder weapon to dispose of, but he has been blackmailing  her ever since.
Now in love with Coral himself, Murdock agrees to leave town with her, but insists on retrieving the
incriminating weapo n first, despite Coral's objections. He threatens Martinelli in his office with a gun,
eliciting some startling revelations: The club owner reveals that Coral is his wife. He killed Chandler
(having learned the man had lied about having only six months to live) and framed Drake so that Coral
could inherit Chandler's estate.
Murdock sets the office on fire by throwing an unstable grenade  at Martinelli, and Krause jumps through
a window to escape  the flames. Murdock obtains the incriminating gun, and forces Martinelli to precede
him out of the of fice. As he opens the door , Martinelli is shot and killed by Coral.Murdock jumps into the waiting car and drives off with Coral. As they are speed ing away , he accuses her
of having just tried to kill him. When she shoots him, the car they are traveling in crashes. Murdock
survives, but Coral suf fers fatal injuries. In the hospital, Murdock comforts Coral in her final moments.

Film scholar Steve Cohan writes in Masked Men: Mascu linity and the Movies in the Fifties  (1997) that a
primary theme of Dead Reckoning  is the failure of the reintegration of war veterans following their
homosocial  bonding during the extreme circumstan ces of combat.[9] He also compares it to Bogart's The
Maltese Falcon  (1941), writing that it recreates the misogyny  of that film through its "rejection of the
femme fatale by reimagining it in masculine terms...  Dead Reck oning  also goes further than that earlier
Bogart film in implicating the tough guy's mistrust of women and his corresponding respect for/rivalry
with other  tough men in a homosexual  desire for the phallic virility with which he identifies as the
measure of his manhood."[10] Writer Emmett Early echoes a similar  sentiment, asserting that the film
contains a "disturbed erotic undertone of misogyny ," citing several pieces of dialogue spoken by Bogart's
character that objectify women.[11]
Cohan also notes that the screenplay combines elements of several of Bogart's previous films, "pushing
his tough-guy persona to the point of unintentional self-parody ."[10]
Dead Reck oning  was originally intended by Columbia Pictures' production chief Harry Cohn as a vehic le
for Rita Hayw orth, a follow-up to the extremely popular  Gilda .[12] Cohn thought that the pairing of
Hayworth and Bogart would be a guaranteed money maker . However , Hayworth was in the middle of a
contract dispute with Columbia, and refused to make the film, so she was replaced by Lizabeth Scott ,
who was borrowed from Paramount Pictures ' producer Hal Wallis.[12][13] Scott, an up-and-coming actressCast
Analysis
Production
Development and castingLizabeth Scott and Humphrey
Bogart in Dead Reckoning (1947)being promoted as "The Threat", was often compared to Bogart's
wife, Lauren Bacall , as both were former models, and had deep,
sultry voices.[14][15] In an interview following the production's
completion, Bogart commented on working with Scott: "I was
warned that she was temperamental, but she couldn't have been
nicer to work with."[16] He also refuted the press's comparisons  of
her to Bacall, instead stating that he felt she more resembled Mayo
Methot , his previous wife. "[16] When Scott first met Bogart, she
gifted him a yachting cap as a nod to his enthusiasm for seafaring
and service in the United States Navy .[17]
Bogart was a loan-out from Warner Bros. as well, and was
reportedly unhappy with being sent to Columbia at the height of
his career, if only because Warner kept any extra money paid by Columbia over and above Bogart's usual
salary .[18] Bogart had right of refusal over the director for the film, and picked John Cromwell . Bogart
and Cromwell had worked together in 1922 on Broadway  in Drifting , a short-lived play by John Colton
and D. H. Andrews, when Bogart was a very young actor and Cromwell, the play's director , cast him in
his first bit part.[18][19]
Principal photography began on June 10, 1946, and was completed on September 4, 1946,[20] with shoots
occurring on the Columbia Pictures soundstages in Los Angeles.[21] Many of Dead Reckoning' s exterior
shots were  filmed on location in St. Petersbur g, Florida .[18][20] Othe r background and location shooting
took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ; LaGuardia Airport  in New York City; and Biloxi,
Mississippi .[1]
Bogart improvised Murdock's extended speech to Scott about men carrying women around in their
pockets, taking them out when they were needed to have dinner with or make love to. This idea was one
that Bogart was known to espouse when he had been drinking.[22]
The film's  original score was composed by Marlin Skiles.[1] The song "Either It's Love or It Isn't", sung
by Lizabe th Scott (dubbed by Trudy Stevens) in the film, had words and music by Allan Roberts and
Doris Fisher .[1]
Dead Reckoning  had its first screening in San Francisco  on December 31, 1946,[3] before opening in a
wide release on January 15, 1947.[1]Filming

RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment  released the film on LaserDisc  on April 25, 1988 .[24]
Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD  in 2002.[25] In 2022, it was included in
a region B Blu-ray  box set of Columbia Pictures noir films by the British distributor Indicator Films.[26]
Indicator later released a standalone Blu-ray on April 22, 2024.[27]

Dead Reckoning  received largely mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release.[8] The New York
Times gave  the film a mixed review , praising Bogart as "beyond criticism in a role such as Dead
Reckoning  affords him", with "some of the best all-around dialogue he has had in a long time."[29]
However , it was less kind to his co-star , Scott, "whose face is expressionless and whose movements are
awkward and deliberate."[29] Although  the actions of Bogart's character are not particularly plausible at
times, and the plot was considered to be "rambling" with "a lot of things about the script ... that an
attentive spectator might find disconce rting," the Times found that "the suspense is skillfully drawn
out."[29][8] The Holly wood Reporter  published  a review describing the film as "almost too tough for its
own good."[10]
Variety  magazine also praised Bogart and liked the film, writing, "Humphrey Boga rt's typically tense
performance raises this average whodunit quite a few notches. Film has good suspense and action, and
some smart direction and photography ... Bogart absorbs one's interest from the start as a tough, quick-
thinking ex-skyjumper . Lizabeth Scott stumbles occasionally as a nitery singer , but on the whole gives a
persuasive sirenish  performance."[30]
In 2004, film critic Dennis Schwartz was critical of the film. He wrote, "This second-rate Bogart vehicle
has the star depart from his usual tough -guy role, though he manages to get into plenty of the action. It
plays as a bleak crime melodrama that is too complexly plotted for its own good ... There's some fun in
watching the Bogart character romanc e the husky-voiced femme fatale character  played by Lizabeth
Scott, but not enough fun to overcome how unconvincing is the sinister plot."[31]Home media

Reception
Critical response
Modern assessmentFilm scholar Robert Miklitsch writes in Siren City: Sound and Source Music in Classic American Noir
(2011) that, despite the studio's effort to model Scott after Bacall, "she's not without her charms. Her
performance... bring s out something Bogart's character that remains occluded in his roles with Bacall,
isolating a certain psychic volatility characteristic of the "tough loner ," the man who knows too
much."[32]
Time Out calls Scott "synthetic" but "alluring ", and detects a "hint of self-parody" in Bogart's
performance. It says that their "relatio nship never quite convinces, leading to a faintly embarrassing
emotional climax." The film, according to the reviewer , "tries too hard to maintain its note of doomed
noir romance," but is nevertheless "[h]ighly enjoyable".[33]
Film scholar Robert  Miklitsch suggests that Dead Reckoning  codified star Lizabeth Scott as "a classic
siren à la Kitty Colli ns in The Killer s," as Scott went on to star as a hard-edged femme fatale in a number
of films noir following it.[32]
