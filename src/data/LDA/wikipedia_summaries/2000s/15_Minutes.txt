15 Minutes
15 Minutes  is a 2001 American satirical  buddy cop
action  thriller film directed and written by John
Herzfeld  and starring Robert De Niro and Edward
Burns . Its story revolves around a homicide detective
(De Niro) and a fire marshal  (Burns) who join forces to
apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers (Karel
Roden  and Oleg Taktarov ) videotaping their crimes in
order to become rich and famous. The title is a
reference to the Andy Warhol  quotation, "In the future,
everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes ."
Ex-convicts Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul arrive in the
United States to claim their part of a bank heist in
eastern Europe . Oleg steals a video camera from an
electronics store. At the rundown apartment of their old
partner , they are denied their share of the spoils, so
Emil fatally stabs the partner and his wife as Oleg
tapes it with the camera. Czech  immigran t Daphne
Handlova witnesses the murders from the bathroom,
then escapes before Emil and Oleg can kill her as well.
To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment.
Jordy Warsaw is a New York City arson  investigator
assigned to the case. Also at the scene is Eddie
Flemming, a high-profile detective who is followed by
his girlfriend Nicolette Karas, a reporter from the
tabloid TV show Top Story . Flemming and Warsaw
agree to work the case together . While checking out the
crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his
attention, but she disappears. Meanwhile , Emil calls an
escort service  and asks for a "Czech girl." Oleg tapes
Emil as he kills the escort and learns the address of the
escort service. Oleg continually films everything,
claiming he wants to be the next Frank Capra .
Flemming and Warsaw investigate this murder and
visit the escort service. The madam, Rose Hearn, tells
them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for
her but rather a hairdresser . She mentions a couple ofPlotRelease date March 9, 2001

Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just
after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep
quiet. Flemming notices Oleg filmin g them from
across the street. In the ensuing foot chase, Flemming's
regular partner Leon Jackson is hit with a glass bottle
and his wallet and gun are stolen. Emil finds a card
with Flemming's name and address.  He becomes
jealous of Flemming 's celebrity status and is convinced
that anyone in America can get away with anything.
On the night Flemming plans to propos e to Nicolette, Oleg and Emil sneak into his apartment and bind
Flemming to a chair . While Oleg is recording, Emil explains that he plans to kill Flemming and sell the
tape to Top Story. After getting hims elf committed to an insane asylum , Emil will declare that he is
actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting royalties  from books and movies
based on his crimes . Flemming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the
upper -hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming
with a pillow .
The entire  city is in a state of mourning. Emil sells the tape of Flemming's murder to Top Story  anchor
Robert Hawkins in exchange for $1 million, outraging Warsaw and the entire police force. Emil and Oleg
watch the tape's broadcast on Top Story  inside a Planet Hollywood ; customers realize that Emil and Oleg
are sitting with them  and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escap es. Warsaw takes Emil to
an abandoned warehouse to kill him, but other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody .
Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity . His lawyer Bruce Cutler
agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story . Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg
becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.
While Cutler is leading Emil away out of court to be transferred to a mental institution, Warsaw provokes
an argument, with the Top Story crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and
hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time.
Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Ticked off for not getting any praise,
Oleg pulls out a gun and opens fire at Emil, only hitting Cutler and a policem an. Emil then grabs the
policeman's gun, shoots and mortally wounds Oleg and grabs Nicolette, threatening to kill her unless the
police drop their weapons. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest, killing him
and avenging Flemming's murder . Hawkins rushes to Oleg's side as he dies. He attempts to get a
comment from Warsaw , who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes  gave  the film an approval rating of 32% based on reviews
from 125 critics, with an average rating of 4.42/10. The site's consensus reads, "As critical as it is about
sensationalism in the media, 15 Minutes  itself indulges in lurid violence, and its satire is too heavy-
handed to be effective."[5] It currently holds a 34 out of 100 rating on Metacritic , based on 32 critic al
reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences gave a C+ CinemaScore .[6]
Roger Ebert  of Chicago Sun-T imes gave it three out of four stars, calling it "a cynical, savage satire about
violence, the media and depravity ." Ebert felt "It doesn't have the polish of "Natural Born Killers " or the
wit of "Wag the Dog," but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage
factory ."[7]Production

Critical responseOn the negative side, Stephen Hunter  of The W ashington Post  wrote:
For a while, as long as it's cops vs. scum, "15 Minutes" bangs along pretty spectacularly . The
contrived script gets Brooks out of the picture fast, so that De Niro and Burns can have a nice
male bonding moment or two, if that's the sort of thing that brings tears to your eyes. ... But like
oh-so-many movies in today's film culture, where nobody ever met a story he could tell, this
one becomes so jammed up with subplots it seems to run out of room, space  and time. ... it
ruins the movie, leaving it without its engine, without its rooting interest, witho ut, really , much
of anything going for it.[8]
Owen Gleiberman  of Entertainment Weekly stated: "At the movies, we're now bamboozled into expecting
not drama but sensation, and so it's no surprise that the plot of a movie like 15 Minutes  is less an end in
itself than an excuse, a jumping-of f point for showy , contrived, borderline-explo itation sequences that fail
to tie together because they're not really  there to do anything but sell themselves as money-shot thrills. ...
15 Minutes  is a glum and sadistic mess."[9]
