1930s
The 1930s  (pronounced "nineteen-thirties" and commonly
abbreviated as "the '30s" or "the Thirti es") was a decade
that began on Januar y 1, 1930, and ended on December 31,
1939. In the Unite d States, the Dust Bowl  led to the
nickname the "Dirty Thirties".
The decad e was defined by a global economic and political
crisis that culminate d in the Second World War. It saw the
collapse of the international financial system, beginning
with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , the largest stock market
crash  in American history . The subsequent economic
downfall, called the Great Depression , had traumatic social
effects worldwide, leading to widesp read poverty  and
unemployment , especiall y in the economic superpowe r of
the United States  and in Germany , which was already
struggling with the payment of reparations for the First
World War. The Dust Bowl  in the United States  (which led
to the nickname the "Dirty Thirties" ) exacerbated the
scarcity of wealth. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ,
who took office in 1933, introduced a program of broad-
scale social reforms and stimulus plans called the New
Deal  in respon se to the crisis. The Soviet Union 's second
five-year plan gave heavy industry top priority , putting the
Soviet Union not far behind Germany  as one of the major
steel-producing countries of the world, while also
improving communications. First-wave feminism  made
advances, with women gaining the right to vote in South
Africa (1930, whites only) , Brazil (1933) , and Cuba
(1933) . Following the rise of Adolf Hitler  and the
emer gence of the NSDAP  as the country's sole legal party
in 1933, Germany imposed a series of laws which
discriminated against Jews  and other ethnic minorities.
Germany adopted an aggressive foreign policy ,
remilitarizing the Rhineland (1936) , annexin g Austria
(1938)  and the Sudetenland (1938) , before invading Poland
(1939)  and starting World War II near the end of the decade. Italy likewi se continued its already aggressive foreign
policy , defeating the Libyan resistance (1932)  before invading Ethiopia (1935)  and then Albania (1939). Both
Germany and Italy became involved  in the Spanish Civil War, supporting the eventually victorious Nationalists  led
by Francisco Franco  against the Republicans , who were in turn supported by the Soviet Union . The Chinese Civil
War was halte d due to the need to confront Japanese imperial ambitions, with the Kuomintang  and the Chinese
Communist Party  forming a Second United Front  to fight Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Lesser conflicts
included interstate wars such as the Colombia–Peru War (1932–1933) , the Chaco War (1932–1935)  and the Saudi–
Yemeni War (1934) , as well as internal conflicts in Brazil (1932) , Ecuador (1932) , El Salvador (1932) , Austria
(1934)  and British Palestine (1936–1939) .Severe famine took place  in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union between 1930 and 1933 , leading to
5.7 to 8.7 million deaths. Major contributing factors to the famine include: the forced collectivization in the Soviet
Union  of agriculture as a part of the First Five-Y ear Plan, forced grain procurement, combined with rapid
industrialization, a decreasing agricultu ral workforce, and several severe droug hts. A famine of similar scope  also
took place in China from 1936 to 1937, killing 5 million people. The 1931 China floods  caused 422,499–4,000,000
deaths. Major earthquakes of this decade include the 1935 Quet ta earthquake  (30,000–60,000 deaths) and the 1939
Erzincan earthquake  (32,700–32,968 deaths).
With the advent of sound  in 1927, the musical —the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over
as the most popular type of film with audiences, with the animated  musical  fantasy film Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs  (1937) becoming the highest-grossing film of this decade in terms of gross rentals. In terms of distributor
rentals, Gone with the Wind (1939), an epic historical  romance film, was the highest-grossing film of this decade and
remains the highest-grossing film (when adjusted for inflation)  to this day. Popularity of comedy films boomed after
the Silent era with popu lar comed ians The Three Stooges  and Marx Brothers. Popular novels of this decade include
the historical fiction  novels The Good Earth , Anthony Adverse  and Gone with the Wind, all three of which were best-
selling novels in the United States  for 2 consecutive years. Cole Porter  was a popular music artist in the 1930s, with
two of his songs, "Night and Day" and "Begin the Beguine " becoming No. 1 hits in 1932 and 1935 respectively . The
latter song  was of the Swing  genre, which had begun to emer ge as the most popular form of music  in the United
States since 1933.
The world population increased from 2.05 to 2.25 billion people during the decade, with about 750 million births
and 550 million deaths.

by the Hitler Youth, the Gestapo , and the SS, during which much of the Jewish population living in
Nazi Germany and Austria was attacked – 91 Jews were murdered, and between 25,000 and 30,000
more were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps . Some 267 synagogues were destroyed,
and thousands of homes and businesses were ransacked. Kristallnacht  also served as the pretext for
the wholesale confiscation of firearms from German Jews.
Germany and Italy pursue territorial expansionist agendas.
Germany demands the annexation of the Federal State of Austria
and of other German-speaking territories in Europe. Between
1935 and 1936, Germany recovers the Saar  and re-militarizes the
Rhineland . Italy initially opposes Germany's aims for Austria, but in
1936 the two countries resolve their dif ferences in the aftermath of
Italy's diplomatic isolation following the start of the Second Italo-
Abyssinian W ar, and Germany becomes Italy's only remaining ally .
Germany and Italy improve relations by forming an alliance
against communism in 1936 with the signing of the Anti-Comintern
Pact. Germany annexes Austria in the Anschluss ; the annexation
of the Sudetenland  follows negotiations which result in the Munich
Agreement  of 1938. The Italian invasion of Albania  in 1939
succeeds in turning the Kingdom of Albania  into an Italian
protectorate . The vacant Albanian throne is claimed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy .[3] Germany

Japan  abdicate the League.
In 1930, Miguel Primo de Rivera , Prime Minister of Spain  and
head of a military dictatorship  is forced to resign in response to a
financial crisis (part of the Great Depression ). Alfonso XIII of
Spain , who had previously backed the dictatorship, attempts to
return gradually to the previous system and restore his prestige.
This failed utterly , as the King was considered a supporter of the
dictatorship, and more and more political forces called for the
establishment of a republic. In 1931, republican and socialist
parties won a major victory in the local elections, while the
monarchists were in decline. Street riots ensued, calling for the
removal of the monarchy . The Spanish Army  declared that they
would not defend the King. Alfonso flees the country , effectively
abdicating and ending the Bourbon Restoration  phase which had
started in the 1870s. A Second Spanish Republic  emerges.

The " Great Purge " of " Old Bolsheviks " from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  takes place from
1936 to 1938, as ordered by Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin , resulting in hundreds of thousands of
people being killed. This purge was due to mistrust and political dif ferences, as well as the massive
drop in grain produce. This was due to the method of collectivization in Russia. The Soviet Union
produced 16 million lbs of grain less in 1934 compared to 1930. This led to the starvation of millions of
Russians.

"Midas touch" the trade press so often attributed to him. Variety , for example, reported that Hell's
Angels  cost $3.2 million to make, and by July , 1931, eight months after its release, the production
cost had nearly been paid of f. Keats claimed the picture cost $4 million to make and that it earned
twice that much within twenty years. The production cost estimate is probably correct. Hughes
worked on the picture for over two years, shooting it first as a silent and then as a talkie. Lewis
Milestone said that in between Hughes experimented with shooting it in color as well. But Variety 's
earnings report must be the fabrication of a delirious publicity agent, and Keats' the working of a
myth maker . During the seven years it was in United Artists distribution, Hell's Angels  grossed
$1.6 million in the domestic market, of which Hughes' share was $1.2 million. Whatever the foreign
gross was, it seems unlikely that it was great enough to earn a profit for the picture. "Books and Magazines on Film5. Feaster , Felicia. "Frankenstein (1931)"  (http://www .tcm.com/this-month/article/373967%7C18617/Fran
