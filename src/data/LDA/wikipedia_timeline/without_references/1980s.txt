1980s
The 1980s  (pronou nced "nineteen-eighties",
shortened to "the '80s" or "the Eight ies") was
the decade that began on January 1, 1980, and
ended on December 31, 1989.
The decade saw a dominance of conservatism
and free market  economics, and a
socioeconomic change due to advances in
technology and a worldwide move away from
planned economies  and towards laissez-faire
capitalism  compared to the 1970s. As economic
deconstruction increased in the developed
world, multiple multinational corporations
associated with the manufacturing industry
relocated into Thailand , Mexico,  South Korea,
Taiwan , and China. Japan and West Germany
saw large economic  growth during this decade.
The AIDS epidemic  became recognized  in the
1980s and has since killed an estimated 40.4
million people (as of 2022 ).[1] Global warming
theory began to spread within the scien tific and
political community in the 1980s.
The United Kingdom and the United States
moved closer to supply-side economic policies ,
beginning a trend towards global instability of
international trade that would pick up more
steam in the following decade  as the fall of the
USSR made right-wing  economic policy more
powerful.
The final decade of the Cold War opened  with
the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely
without any interruption. Superpower tensions
escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped
the policy  of détente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world
came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis  in 1962, but the
second half of the decade  saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse
of Soviet communism.Developing countrie s across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from
multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from
the International Moneta ry Fund  (IMF) and the World Bank . Ethiopia  witnessed widespread famine in the
mid-1980s  during the corrupt rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam , resulting in the country having to depe nd
on foreign  aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to addres s and raise money to help
Ethiopians, such as the Live Aid concert in 1985.
Major civil discontent and violence occurred, including the Angolan Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War,
the Moro conflict , the Salvadoran Civil War, the Ugandan Bush War, the insur gency in Laos , the Iran–
Iraq War, the Soviet–Afghan War, the 1982 Lebanon War, the Falklands War, the Second Sudanese Civil
War, the Lord's Resistance Army insur gency , and the First Nagorno-Karab akh War. Islamism  became a
powerful political force in the 1980s and many jihadist  organizations, including Al Qaeda , were set up.
By 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc, and the desire for democracy in
socialist states , combined with economic recession, resulted in Mikhail Gorbachev 's glasnost  and
perestroika , which reduced Communist Party power , legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of
capitalism such as joint ventures  with companies from capitalist  countries. After tension for most of the
decade, by 1988 relations between the communist and capitalist blocs had improved significantly[2] and
the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states.
1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow  of a number of governments led by communist
parties, such as in Hungary , the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989  in China,  the Czechoslovak "Velvet
Revolution" , Erich Honecker 's East German regim e, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and the violent
overthrow  of the Nicolae Ceaușescu  regime in Romania . Destruction of the 155-km Berlin Wall, at the
end of the decade, signaled a seismic geopolitical shift. The Cold War ended in the early 1990s with the
successful Reunification of Germany  and the USSR's demise  after the August Coup  of 1991.
The 1980s was an era of tremendous population growth around the world, surpassing the 1970s and
1990s, and arguably  being the largest in human history . During the 1980s, the world population grew
from 4.4 to 5.3 billion people. There were approximately 1.33 billion births  and 480 million deaths.
Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and South Asian
countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually . The 1980s
saw the advent of the ongoing practice of sex-selective abortion  in China  and India as ultrasound
technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.[3]
The 1980s  saw great advances in genet ic and digital technology . After years of animal experimentation
since 1985 , the first genetic modification of 10 adult human beings took place in May 1989, a gene
tagging  experiment[4] which led to the first true gene therap y implementation in September 1990. The
first "designer babies ", a pair of female twins, were created in a laboratory in late 1989 and born in July
1990 after being sex-selected via the controversial assisted reproductive technology  procedure
preimplantation genetic diagnosis .[5] Gestational surrogac y was first performed in 1985 with the first
birth in 1986, making it possible for a woman to become a biological mother without experiencing
pregnancy for the first time in history .[6]
The global internet  took shape in academia by the second half of the 1980s, as well as many other
computer networks  of both academic and commercial use such as USENET , Fidonet , and the bulletin
board system . By 1989 , the Internet and the networks linked to it were a global system with extensive
transoceanic satellite  links and nodes in most developed countries .[7] Based on earlier work, from 1980Cold War Map of Communist &
Socialist countries in 1985

became commonpla ce in the Third World, with the number of TV sets in China and India increasing by
15 and 10 times respectively .[8]
The Atari Video Computer System  console became widespread in the first part of the decade, often
simply called "Atari". 1980 Atari VCS port of Space Invaders  was the first killer app. The video game
crash of 1983  ended the system's popularity and decim ated the industry until the Nintendo Entertainm ent
System  re-established the console market in North America. The hand-held Game Boy launched in 1989.
Super Mario Bros. and Tetris were the decade's best selling games. Pac-Man  was the highest grossing
arcade game. Home computers  became commonplace. The 1981 IBM PC led to a large market for IBM
PC compatibles . The 1984 release of the Macintosh  popularized the WIMP  style of interaction.
The most prominent armed conflicts  of the decade include:
The most notable wars of the decade include:
The Cold W ar (1947–1991)
Soviet–Afghan W ar (1979–1989) – a war fought
between the Soviet Union and the Islamist
Mujahideen Resistance in Afghanistan. The
mujahideen found other support from a variety of
sources including the Central Intelligence Agency  of
the United States (see Operation Cyclone ), as well
as Saudi Arabia , Pakistan and other Muslim nations
through the context of the Cold W ar and the regional
India–Pakistan conflict.
Invasion of Grenada  (1983) – a 1983 U.S.-led
invasion of Grenada , triggered by a military coup
which ousted a brief revolutionary  government. The
successful invasion led to a change of government but was controversial due to charges
of American imperialism , Cold W ar politics, the involvement of Cuba , the unstable state
of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a Commonwealth realm .
Salvadoran Civil W ar (1980–1992) – part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in
the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died.
Cambodian–V ietnamese W ar (1978–1991)
Argentina invaded  the Falkland Islands , sparking the Falklands W ar. It occurred from April 2
to July 14, 1982, between the United Kingdom and Argentina  as British forces fought to
recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international af fairs and its
long-decaying reputation as a colonial power  received an unexpected boost. The military
junta  of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader
Leopoldo Galtieri  was deposed three days after the end of the war . A military investigation
known as the Rattenbach Report even recommended his execution.Politics and wars
Wars
International warsArab–Israeli conflict  (early 20th century – present)
1982 Lebanon W ar – the Government of Israel  ordered the invasion as a response to
the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo
Argov , by the Abu Nidal Organization  and due to the constant terror attacks on northern
Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the
PLO, as well as Syrian , leftist and Muslim  Lebanese  forces, Israel occupied southern
Lebanon and eventually surrounded the PLO in west Beirut  and subjected to heavy
bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon.
In October 1985 eight Israeli F-15 Eagles  carried out Operation W ooden Leg  intending
to bomb the PLO's new headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia , more than 2,000 km from Israel.
The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later
condemned by the United Nations Security Council . The United States is thought to
have assisted or known of the attack.
The Iran–Iraq W ar took place from 1980 to 1988. Iraq was accused of using illegal chemical
weapons  to kill Iranian  forces and against its own dissident Kurdish  populations. Both sides
suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suf fered worse for it,
being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an
armistice in 1988.

that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of communism  and end illicit drug trade.
The U.S. government supported the government of Colombia's attempts  to destroy its
large illicit cocaine -trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military
government in the Salvadoran civil war  which became controversial after the El Mozote
massacre  on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed
1000 Salvadoran civilians.

and Nevis  (1983) in the Caribbean; Brunei  (1984) and Thailand  formed a US-British
government (1981) in Southeast Asia.
Ronald Reagan  was elected U.S. president in 1980. In
international af fairs, Reagan pursued a hardline policy
towards preventing the spread of communism, initiating
a considerable buildup of U.S. military power to
challenge the Soviet Union. He further directly
challenged the Iron Curtain  by demanding that the
Soviet Union dismantle the Berlin W all.
The Reagan Administration  accelerated the War on
Drugs , publicized through anti-drug campaigns including
the Just Say No  campaign of First Lady Nancy Reagan .
Drugs gained attention in the US as a serious problem in
the '80s. Cocaine was relatively popular among
celebrities and af fluent youth, while crack, a cheaper
offshoot of the drug, was linked to high crime rates in inner cities during the American crack
epidemic .
The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)  (PATCO) declared a strike on
August 3, 1981, seeking better working conditions, better pay , and a 32-hour workweek. The
strike caused considerable disruption of the U.S. air transportation system. Resolution came
when Ronald Reagan  fired over 11,000 striking air traf fic controllers who had ignored his
order to return to work, banning them from federal service for life. After seeking appeals,
many of the controllers were re-hired while the F AA attempted to replace much of their air
traffic control staf fing. The remainder continued to be banned until President Clinton lifted
the final aspects in 1993.
Political unrest in the province of Quebec , which, due to the many dif ferences between the
dominant francophone population and the anglophone minority , and also to francophone
rights in the predominantly English -speaking Canada, came to a head in 1980 when the
provincial government called a public referendum  on partial separation from the rest of
Canada. The referendum ended with the "no" side winning majority (59.56% no, 40.44%
yes).Prominent political events

years.
The European Community 's enlargement  continued with the
accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986.
In 1983, Bettino Craxi  became the first socialist  to hold the of fice of
Prime Minister of Italy ; he remained in power until 1987, becoming
one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers in the history of Italian
Republic. At the end of his presidency the Mani pulite  corruption
scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system.
Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist
countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries
grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing
communist governments. These reforms included attempts to
increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and
promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in
eastern Europe was generally peaceful, the exception being
Romania , whose leader Nicolae Ceaușescu  tried to keep the
people isolated from the events happening outside the country .
While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was
booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the
city with his wife Elena . Two days later , they were captured,
charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas Day .
In Yugoslavia , following the death of communist leader Josip Broz
Tito in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist
system occurred along with a trend towards ethnic nationalism  and
inter-ethnic hostility , especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986
Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts
followed by the agenda of Serbian communist leader Slobodan
Milošević  who aggressively pushed for increased political
influence of Serbs in the late 1980s, condemning non-Serb
Yugoslav politicians who challenged his agenda as being enemies
of Serbs.
There was continuing civil strife  in Northern Ireland , including the
adoption of hunger strikes by Irish Republican Army  prisoners
seeking the reintroduction of political status.
Mikhail Gorbachev  became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985,
and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of
expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while
maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with
the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the Cold W ar.
During the Revolutions of 1989 , most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe
collapsed. The fall of the Berlin W all in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the German
reunification .
The United Kingdom was governed by the Conservative Party  under Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher , the first female leader of a W estern country . Under her Premiership , the
party introduced widespread economic reforms including the privatisation  of industries and
the de-regulation of stock markets  echoing similar reforms of U.S. President  Ronald
Reagan . She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname The
Iron Lady .EuropePoor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the UK miners' strike (1984–
85) was a major industrial action  affecting the UK coal industry . The strike by the National
Union of Mineworkers  (NUM) was led by Arthur Scargill , although some NUM members
considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The BBC has referred to the
strike as "the most bitter industrial dispute in British history ."[9] At its height, the strike
involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the 1926 General Strike .[10]
In November 1982, Leonid Brezhnev , who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He
was followed in quick succession by Yuri Andropov , the former KGB chief, and Konstantin
Chernenko , both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in of fice.
Following the assassination of Park Chung-hee , South Korean president Chun Doo Hwan
came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired
in 1987. He was responsible for the Gwangju Uprising  in May 1980 when police and soldiers
battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement
during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, a bomb apparently planted by North
Korean agents  killed a number of South Korean government of ficials. The June Democratic
Struggle  in 1987, a nationwide pro-democracy movement in South Korea, leads to
democratic reforms, an end to authoritarian rule and democratic elections . After leaving
office, Chun was succeeded by Roh Tae W oo, the first democratic ruler of the country , which
saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988 . Roh pursued a
policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant left-
wing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea  and the withdrawal of
US troops.
In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president Ferdinand
Marcos  left the presidency and was replaced by Corazon Aquino  through the " People Power
Revolution " from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful
revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to
disperse the crowds on EDSA  (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila).
Democratization in South Korea and Taiwan, having lasted 42 and 27 years under the
authoritarian regime since the end of W orld W ar II and the Korean W ar (including the lifting
of martial law in Taiwan  and the first direct presidential elections  in South Korea).
The 1988 Summer Olympics  were held in South Korea, the first time the country hosted
them.

A widespread famine hit Ethiopia  from 1983 to 1985, af fecting 7.75 million people, killing
around 300,000 to 1.2 million. 400,000 refugees left the country . Blame for the famine has
been attributed to drought, Ethiopia's civil war , and policies taken by the Derg  military
regime.

Science and technology
Medicine and biologyThe 1980s had many  fundamental advances in medicine and biology . The first surrogate pregnancy  of an
unrelated child took place on April 13, 1986, in Michigan.[6] The first genetically modified  crops, tobacco
(Nicotiana ) plants were grown in China in 1988.[23]
Gene therapy technique s became established by the end of the 1980s, allowing gene taggi ng and gene
therapy  to becom e a possibility , both of which  were first performed in human beings in May 1989 and
September 1990, respectively .
Arcade  and video games had been growing in popularity since the late 1970s, and by 1982 were a major
industry . But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers,
caused a tremendous crash  in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically
ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by Nintendo , whose
Famicom console and mascot Mario  had been enjoying  considerable success in Japan since 1983.
Renamed the Nintendo Entertainm ent System  (NES), it would claim 90% of the American video game
market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive
popularity . In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video
games of all time. Also in 1980, Game & Watch was created; it was not one of the best known game
systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. Donkey Kong, released in 1981,
was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for Nintendo . Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2,
Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and the Mega Man series would becom e major hits for the
console.

a full-fledged consumer product. The IBM PC, launched in 1981, became the dominant computer for
professional users. Commodore  created the most popular home computers of both 8-bit and 16-bit
generations. MSX  standard was the dominant computer platform in Japan and in most parts of Asia.
Apple Com puter  supersede d its Apple II and Lisa models by introducing the first Macintosh  computer  in
1984. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface  (GUI)
and mouse ,[24] which started to become general features in computers after the middle of the decade.
Electronics and computers were also at the forefront of the advertising industry , with many commercials
like "1984" from Apple achieving acclaim and pop-culture relevance.[25]
IBM PC (model 5150), the first
DOS-compatible PC was
released in 1981. The IBM PCs
and compatible models from
other vendors would become
the most widely used computer
systems in the world.

Walkman  and boomboxes , invented during the late 1970s, became very popular as they were introduced
to various  countries in the early 1980s, and had a profound impact on the music industry and youth
culture. Consumer VCRs  and video rental stores became commonplace as VHS  won out over the
competing Betamax  standard. In addition, in the early 1980 s various companies began selling compact,
modestly priced synthesizers  to the public. This, along with the development of Musical Instrument
Digital Interface  (MID I), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic
instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.
High defin ition television  (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the
1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.
In 1981, Hayes Microcomputer Products  started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the
way for the modern  modems that exist today , mainly because it was the first modem to transform what
had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem
contributed to the rise in popularity of BBS  systems in the 1980 s and early 1990s, which were the main
way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the
Internet  and the World Wide Web finally became popular in the mid-1990s.In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC

(1985), and Windows 2.0  (1987).
The CD – the most basic CD ("Digital Audio Compact Disc") was released in October 1982
for distribution and listening to digital audio , and at the time contained up to 74 minutes of
music.
TCP/IP : ARPANET  officially changed its main protocol from NCP  to TCP/IP  on January 1,
1983, when the new protocols were activated. The TCP/IP  protocol will become theInformation technologydominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as the
foundation on which the Internet  would be based.
The GNU Project  (1983). The Free Software Foundation  (1985).
FidoNet  – In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling BBS users to send private messages
(e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connected
to the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other . The rise in popularity and
availability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed to
the irrelevance of FidoNet.
World W ide W eb – In 1989, the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee  first proposed a
project to his employer CERN , based on the concept of hypertext , to facilitate sharing and
updating information among researchers. In mid-November 1989 he would develop the first
successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol  (HTTP) client and server
via the internet . In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would later
become the foundation of the World Wide W eb.
In 1981, Microsoft introduced
the MS-DOS operating system,
which would become the world's
most widely used operating
system in the 1980s and first
half of the 1990s. 
The most basic CD was first

American interplane tary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After
making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980–1981. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in
1986 (just a few days before the Challenger  disas ter), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the
Solar System.Space explorationThe Space Shuttle Columbia
seconds after engine ignition, 1981No American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the
Viking  probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations
by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they
failed.
The arriva l of Halley's Comet  in 1986 was met by a series of
Soviet, Japanese and European Space Agency  (ESA) probes,
namely Halley Armada .
After a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts
resumed with the launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia  in April
1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with
three more orbiters entering service in 1983–1985. But that all
came to an end with the tragic loss of the Challenger  (STS-51-L )
on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including
Christa McAulif fe, who was to have been the first teacher  in space. In full view of the world, a faulty O-
ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it
to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve NASA 's
increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer . Flights resumed with the
launch of Discovery  in September 1988.
The Sovie t program  with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks.
The Salyut 6 space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by Salyut 7 in 1982. Then came Mir in 1986,
which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet
space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last "superprojects" was the Buran  space
shuttle ; it was only used once, in 1988.
The American auto industry began in the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality
control, rising impo rt competition, and a severe economic downturn.[28] Chrysler  and American Motors
(AMC) were near bankruptcy , and Ford  was little better off.[29] Only General Motors  (GM) continued
with busin ess as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales
in the United States hit a new record. However , the Japanese were now a major presence, and would
begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai  became the first Korean auto
maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built Yugo was broug ht to the US,
but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.
As the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford  design teams
began to incorporate aerodynamic stylin g to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird  was one of
the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus  with a design that was
revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.
GM began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith 's
restructuring attemp ts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars. An example were customers who
increasingly purchas ed European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs . In 1985, GM starte d Saturn  (the firstAutomobilesnew American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters. Production
would not begin until 1990.
Chrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive K-cars  in 1981. Under the leadership of Lee
Iacocca , the comp any turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans.
A succession of models using this autom obile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans
in 1984. These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade.
In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lambor ghini  and Maserati . In the same year, Chrysler
bought AMC  from Renault  laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker , but acquiring
the hugely profitable Jeep line and continuing the Eagle  brand until the late 1990s.[30]
The DMC DeLorean  was the brainchil d of John DeLorean , a flamb oyant former GM executive.
Production of the gull-winged sports car began in Northern Ireland in 1981. John DeLorean was arrested
in October 1982 in a sting operation where he was attempting to sell cocai ne to save his struggling
company . He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company , which
closed down in 1983. The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the Back to
the Futur e film trilogy .
The impos ition of corporate average fuel economy  (CAFE) fuel-milea ge standards in 1979 spelled the
end of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles  reemer ged in the 1980s. Turbochar gers
were widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from fuel injection  began to
take over from the widely used application of carburetors  by the late 1980s.  Front-wheel drive also
became dominant.
The 1980s marked the decline of Europ ean brands in North America by the end of the decade. Renault,
Citroën , and Peugeot  ceased importation by the end of the decade. Alfa Romeo  would continue until
1993. Fiat also ceased imports to North America in the 1980s.
The early 1980s was marked by a severe global economic recession  that af fected much of
the developed world.
Inflation peaked in the U.S. in April 1980 at 14.76% and subsequently fell to a low of 1.10%
in December 1986 but then rebounded to 4.65% at the end of the decade.[31]
Finland's economy grew by almost the fastest pace in the world, which eventually
culminated in the recession of the 1990s Finnish economy . In Finland, the 1980s were
called the "Nousukausi", or "economic upswing".
In the late 1980s, Japan experienced an economic bubble , which would culminate in a stock
market crash in 1991 that would begin a period of economic stagnation .
Developing countries reliant on loans from the International Monetary Fund  would
experience debt crises throughout the 1980s.
Laissez faire  and neoliberal  economics have a resurgence in the developed world, led by
the UK and US which emphasised reduced government intervention, lower taxes and
deregulation of the stock markets, measures that became associated with an economic
revival in the mid- to late-1980s.
Brazil and Mexico suf fers from a debt crisis in Latin America  starting in 1982 under
President João Figueiredo  and Miguel de la Madrid . Economic problems worsened between
1979 and 1985 by firing and resignation of most of ficials of the Brazilian and MexicanEconomicsgovernment after the Diretas Já  movement in 1984, and a failed response of emergency aid
in the Mexico City earthquake  just after the 175th anniversary of independence holiday in
1985. Tancredo Neves  (later succeeded by José Sarney  three months later) and Carlos
Salinas de Gortari  won a direct presidential election  in 1985 marked the end of a 21-year
military dictatorship , and a controversial presidential election  in 1988 amid charges of voter
fraud, bribery , corruption and other abuses of power .
Enactment of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement  in 1989 to further establish
a strong economic bond between the two prosperous neighbor countries of North America.
In the Soviet Union, the eleventh Five-Y ear Plan  was initiated in 1981 during a period of
economic stagnation  that began in the late 1970s. The Plan was a near failure, as most of
the targets were not met. With the ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev  as General Secretary  of the
Communist Party , the twelfth Five-Y ear Plan sought to accelerate  and restructure  the Soviet
economy through reforms to decentralize production and distribution systems.
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping , China embarked on extensive reforms  in the 1980s,
opening the country's economy to the W est and allowing capitalist enterprises to operate in
a market socialist system . The corruption of Communist Party  leadership was met by
dissent from students and workers in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989  which were
suppressed by the People's Liberation Army .
The Solidarity movement  began in Poland in 1980, involving workers demanding political
liberalization and democracy in Poland. Attempts by the Communist government to prevent
the rise of the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and the
government took place. Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in other
communist states to demand political reform.
The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been since
the 1920s, and figures like Donald Trump  and Michael Milken  were widely seen as symbols
of the decade. Widespread fear of Japanese economic strength would grip the United
States in the 1980s.
The "Black Monday" stock market crash  on October 19, 1987, decreased the value of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average  by more than 22%, causing widespread secondary drops in
world markets.
During the 1980s, for the first time in world history , transpacific trade (with East Asia, such
as China, and Latin America, primarily with Mexico) equaled that of transatlantic trade (with
Western Europe  or with neighboring Canada),[32] solidifying American economic power .[33]
The Savings and Loan crisis  and Keating five  scandal.
The phrase Big Bang , used in reference to the sudden deregulation of financial markets,
was coined to describe measures, including abolition of fixed commission charges and of
the distinction between stockjobbers and stockbrokers on the London Stock Exchange and
change from open-outcry to electronic, screen-based trading, ef fected by Margaret Thatcher
in 1986.

1980s teen-oriented films like
Fast Times at Ridgemont High,
Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Back to
the Future, The Breakfast Club,
Stand by Me, and The Outsiders
were popular under the Reagan
era. 
After a turbulent decline in the
1960s and 1970s, animation
began to thrive again due to the
success and popularity of films
such as Who Framed Roger
Rabbit, Oliver & Company, The
Land Before Time, and The
Little Mermaid.Along with early hip hop culture
like 1988's Straight Outta
Compton, graffiti became more
mainstream in the 1980s. 
Before the more mainstream
use of the internet in the 1990s,
many computer systems had
searchable databases during
the decade. These databases
could be used to search a
students' grades, computerized
library and video rental systems
to track books and video rentals.
Ronald Reagan was president
of the United States for a
majority of the 1980s (1981–
1989), during what was called
the Reagan era. Ronald
Reagan's vice president George
H.W. Bush became president in
1989.
In the United States , MTV  was launc hed and music videos began to have a larger effect on the record

(1984)The film industry
The 1980s saw the return of studio-driven films, coming from the filmmaker -driven New Hollywood  era
of the 1970s.[44] The period was when 'high concept ' films gained popularity , where movies were to be
easily marketable and understandable, and, therefore, they had short cinematic plots  that could be
summarized in one or two sentences. The modern Hollywood blockbuster  is the most popular film format
from the 1980s. Producer Don Simp son[45] is usually credited with the creation of the high-concept
picture of the mode rn Hollywood blockbuster . In the mid-1980s, a wave of British directors, including
Ridley Scott , Alan Parker , Adrian Lyne and Tony Scott  (with the latter directing a number of Don
Simpson films) ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they had honed in
UK television commercials.[46]
A significant development in the home media business is the establishment of The Criterion Collection  in
1984, an American company "dedicate d to gathering the greatest films from around the world and
publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality". Through their releases, they were
able to introduce what is now a standar d to home video: letterboxing  to retain the origin al aspect ratio,
film commentaries  and supplements/special features.[47][48]
Live-action films
The 1980s also saw the golden age of "teen flicks " and also spawned the
Brat Pack  films, many of which were directed by John Hughes . Films
such as Class , The Breakfast Club , Fast Times at Ridgemont High ,
Mannequin , Porky's , Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles , St. Elmo's Fire,

comedies of the era and launched the careers of several major celebrities
such as: Emilio Estevez , Anthony Michael Hall, Forest Whitaker , Jennifer
Jason Leigh , Andrew McCarthy , Judd Nelson , Molly Ringwald , Sean
Penn , Nicolas Cage  and Michael J. Fox. Other popular films included
About Last Night... , Bill & Ted's Excell ent Adventur e, Dirty Dancing,

launched the careers of high-profile celebrities like Demi Moore, Joe
Pesci , Keanu Reeves, Kevin Bacon, Rob Lowe , Patrick Swayze, and River
Phoenix .
Horror films were a popular genre during the decade, with several notable
horror franchises being born during the 1980s. Among the most popular were the Friday the 13th, A
Nightmar e on Elm Street, Halloween , Child's Play, Hellraiser , and Polter geist  franchises. The Shining
although a popular film from 1980 decades later, it was initially met with mixed  reviews from critics and
even the author  of the book , and was moderately successful financially . Aside from these films, the
concept of the B horror film gave rise to a pleth ora of horror films that went on to earn a cult status. An
example of such is the 1981 film The Evil Dead , which marked the directorial debut of Sam Raimi .
Comedy horror films such as Beetlejuice  and Gremlins  also gained cult status.

and RoboCop . These films propelled the careers of modern celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzene gger,Bruce Willis, Sigourney Weaver , Mel Gibson , Danny Glover , and Charlie Sheen  to international
recognition. On the other side of the globe, Hong Kong action cinema  and martial arts films  were being
revolutionized by a new wave of inventive filmmakers that include Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Tsui
Hark , and John Woo, while the American martial arts film movement was being led by actors like Chuck
Norris , Jean-Claude Van Damme  and Steven Seagal .
Five more  James Bond films  were released, with Roger Moore continuin g in the role in For Your Eyes
Only , Octopussy , and A View To A Kill, before handing over the role to Timothy Dalton  who starred in
The Living Daylights  and Licence T o Kill .
The post-2000 popularity of blockbuster superhero films  is attributed in part to the start such blockbuster
films gained in the 1980s, starting with Salkind's Superman  film serie s 1978 –1987 and bookended at the
end of the decade with Tim Burton 's 1989 Batman .[49] Similarly , the popularity of science fiction films in
the 1980s  is attributable to the popularity of the Star Wars original trilogy  (1977–1983).[50]

According to decadeology , cultural decades do not necessarily line up with their numerical counterparts.
For example, the 1980s are said by some to have begun in 1979 with the New Rom antic  movement (of
which new wave  music  was a part), the Iranian Revolution , and the election of Margaret Thatcher .[59]
Meanwhile, the Chicago Sun-T imes  declared the 1977 Star Wars as the first movie of the eighties.[60] A
shift in television happened in the late 1970s as well: of the top shows consid ered to be "shows of the
1980s", more began  1978–1979 than began 1980–1981.[61][62] 1977 also saw[63] the introduction of
ROM  cartridge-based video game consoles , with the Atari Video Computer System, the Fairchild
Channel F, and the Bally Astrocade , as well as seeing the introduction of the first mass-produced  home
computers, with the Apple II, the TRS-80 , and the Commodore PET .

era".[64] Music saw a change, with the premier of Yo! MTV Raps  on Augu st 6, 1988, which was
coincidentally the same date as the last broadcast of Casey Kasem  hosting American Top 40. On the

Cultural start and end of the decadeThe Last Temptation of Christ  and the three televangelist  scandals of Jim Bakker , Jimmy Swaggart , and
Oral Robe rts.[65] The years 1988–1993 are sometimes called the neighties  for being a cultura l bridge
between the politically conservative 1980s and the Internet boom  of the 1990s, which was kicked off by
the release of Mosaic  in 1993.[66]
