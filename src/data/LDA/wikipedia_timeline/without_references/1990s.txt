1990s
The 1990s  (ofte n referred and shortened to as "the '90s" or "nineties ") was the decade  that
began on 1 January 1990, and ended on 31 December 1999. Known as the "post-Cold War
decade ", the 1990s were culturally imagined as the period from the Revolutions of 1989  until
the September 11 attacks  in 2001.[1] The dissolution of the Soviet Union  marked the end of
Russia's status as a superpower , the end of a multipolar  world, and the rise of anti-W estern
sentiment . China was still recovering from a politically and economically turbulent period .[2]
This allowed the US to emer ge as the world 's sole superpower , creating relative peace  and
prosperity  for many  western countries. During this decade, the world population  grew  from
5.3 to 6.1 billion.[3]
The decad e saw greater attention to multiculturalism  and advance of alternative media .
Public education about safe sex curbed HIV in develo ped count ries. Generation X bonded
over musi cal tastes . Humor in televisi on and film was marked by ironic self-references
mixed with popular culture  references. Alternative music movemen ts like grunge , reggaeton ,
Eurodance , and hip-hop , became popular , aided by the rise in satellite  and cable television ,
and the internet . New music genres such as drum and bass, post-rock , happy hardcore ,
denpa , and trance  emer ged. Video game popularity exploded due to the development of CD-
ROM  supported 3D computer graphics  on platfor ms such as Sony PlayStation , Nintendo 64,
and PCs.
The 1990s  saw advances in technolo gy, with the World Wide Web, evolution  of the Pentium
microprocessor , rechargeable lithium-ion batteries , the first gene thera py trial, and cloning .
The Human Genome Project  was launched in 1990, building the Large Hadron Collider
commenced in 1998, and Nasdaq  became the first US stock market to trade online.[4]
Environmentalism  divided between left-wing green politics , primary industry -sponsored
environmentalist front organizations , and a more business-oriented approach to the
regulation of carbon footprint  of busine sses. More businesses started using information
technology .
There was a realignment and consolid ation of economic  and political power , such as the
continued mass-mobilization of capital markets  through neoliberalism , globalization , and end of the Cold War. Network cultures were enhanced
by the proliferation of new media  such as the internet, and a new ability to self-publish web pages and make connections on professional, political
and hobby topics. The digital divide was immediate, with access limited to those who could afford it and knew how to operate a computer . The
internet provided anonymity for individuals skeptical of the government. Traditional mass media continued to perform strongly . However ,
mainstream internet  users were optimistic about its benefits particularly the future of e-commerce . Web portals , a curated bookmar k homepage,
were as popular as searching via web crawlers . The dot-com bubble  of 1997–2 000 brought wealth to some entrepreneurs  before its crash of the
early-2000s .
Many countries were economically prosperous and spreading globalization . High-income countries  experienced steady growth during the Great
Moderation  (1980s—2000s). Using a mobile phone  in a publi c place was typical conspicuous consum ption . In contra st, the GDP  of former Soviet
Union  states declined as a result of neoliberal restructuring. International trade  increased with the establishment of the European Union  (EU) in
1993, North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFT A) in 1994, and World Trade Organization  (WTO) in 1995. The Asia-Pacific  economie s of
the Four Asian Tigers , ASEAN , Australia and Japan were hampered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis  and early 1990s recession .Major wars that began include the First and Second Congo Wars, the Rwandan Civil War and genocide , the Somali Civil War, and Sierra Leone
Civil War in Africa ; the Yugoslav Wars in Southeast Europe ; the First and Second Chechen Wars, in the former Soviet Union; and the Gulf War in
the Middle East. The Afghanistan conflict (1978–present)  and Colombian conflict  continued . The Oslo Acco rds seemed to herald an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict , but this was in vain. However , in Northern Ireland , The Troubles came to a standstill in 1998 with the Good Friday
Agreement , ending 30 years of violence.[5]

The Congo W ars began in the 1990s.[6]
The First Congo W ar (24 October 1996 – 16 May 1997) resulted in the overthrow of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko , his 32 rule
of Zaire , which was then renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The Second Congo W ar (August 1998 – July 2003) started in Central Africa  and involved multiple nearby nations.
The Gulf W ar (2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991).
Iraq was left in severe debt after the Iran–Iraq W ar in the 1980s. President Saddam Hussein  accused Kuwait  of flooding the
oil market, therefore driving down prices. As a result, Iraqi forces invaded and conquered Kuwait .
The UN ( United Nations ) immediately condemned the action and a coalition force led by the United States  was sent to the
Persian Gulf . Aerial bombing of Iraq  began in January 1991, and one month later , the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from
Kuwait in four days.
Two wars were fought in the region of Chechnya :
The First Chechen W ar (1994–1996) was a conflict between the Russian Federation  and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria .
After the initial campaign of 1994–1995, culminating in the devastating Battle of Grozny , Russian federal forces attempted to
seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya. Despite Russia's overwhelming manpower , weaponry , and air support ,
they were set back by Chechen guerrillas  and raids on the flatlands. The resulting widespread demoralization of Russian
federal forces, and the universal  opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led Boris Yeltsin 's government to declare a
ceasefire  in 1996 and sign a peace treaty  a year later .
The Second Chechen W ar (1999 – 2009) was started by the Russian Federation in response to the 1999 invasion of
Dagestan  and the Russian apartment bombings , which were blamed on the Chechens. In this military campaign, Russian
forces largely recaptured the separatist region of Chechnya  and the outcome of the First Chechen W ar – in which the region
gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria – was essentially reversed.
The Eritrean–Ethiopian W ar (1998–2000) was commenced by the invasion of Ethiopia by Eritrea due to a territorial dispute.[7]
The conflict resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides[8] and a peace agreement in December 2000.[9]
The Kargil W ar (1999) began in May when Pakistan covertly sent troops to occupy strategic peaks in Kashmir . A month later , the
Kargil W ar with India resulted in a political fiasco for Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , followed by a Pakistani military
withdrawal to the Line of Control . The incident led to a Pakistani military coup  in October , in which Sharif was ousted by Army
Chief  Pervez Musharraf . This conflict remains the only war fought between the two declared nuclear powers.
The Yugoslav W ars (1991–1995) followed the breakup of Yugoslavia , beginning on 25 June 1991, after the republics of Croatia
and Slovenia  declared independence from Yugoslavia . These wars were notorious for war crimes and human rights violations,
including ethnic cleansing  and genocide , with the overwhelming majority of casualties being Muslim Bosniaks .
The Ten-Day W ar (1991) was a brief military conflict between Slovenian TO (Slovenian Territorial Defence ) and the Yugoslav
People's Army  ("JNA") following Slovenia 's declaration of independence.Politics and wars

Yugoslavia ) and both the Yugoslav People's Army  ("JNA") and Serb  forces, who established the
self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina  ("RSK") within Croatia.
The Bosnian W ar (1992–1995) involved several ethnically -defined factions within Bosnia and
Herzegovina : Bosniaks , Serbs , and Croats , as well as a smaller Bosniak faction led by Fikret Abdić .
The Siege of Sarajevo  (1992–1995) marked the most violent urban warfare  in Europe since World
War II at that time, as Serb  forces bombarded and attacked Bosnian-controlled and populated
areas of the city . War crimes occurred, including ethnic cleansing  and the destruction of civilian
property .
The final fighting in the Croatian and Bosnian wars ended in 1995 with the success of Croatian
military of fensives against Serb forces. This led to the mass exodus of Serbs  from Croatia, Serb
losses to Croat and Bosniak forces, and the signing of the Dayton Agreement , which internally
partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a Republika Srpska  and a Bosniak-Croat Federation .
The Kosovo W ar (1998–1999) was a war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb
paramilitary forces in Kosovo . That conflict began in 1996 and escalated in 1998, with increasing
reports of atrocities.
In 1999, the NATO, led by the United States, launched air attacks  against Yugoslavia  (then composed of only Serbia  and
Montenegro ) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in Kosovo . The
intervention lacked UN approval yet was justified by NA TO based on accusations of war crimes committed by Yugoslav
military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups. Finally , after months of bombing, Yugoslavia conceded
to NA TO's demands, and NA TO forces (later UN peacekeeping forces) occupied Kosovo.
The South African Border W ar (1990) was a border war between Zambia , Angola , and Namibia  that began in 1966 and ended in

canceling the first multi-party elections in Algeria .[10]
The Somali Civil W ar (1991–present) included the Battle of Mogadishu .
The Rwandan genocide  (1994) occurred from 6 April to mid-July 1994 when hundreds of
thousands of Rwanda 's Tutsis and Hutu  political moderates were killed  by the Hutu -
dominated government under the Hutu Power  ideology . For approximately 100 days between
500,000[11] and 1,000,000[12] people were killed. The United Nations and major states came
under criticism for failing to stop the genocide.
1993 Russian constitutional crisis  resulted from a severe political deadlock  between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin  and the Supreme Soviet  (Russia's parliament at this time) resulting in Yeltsin ordering the controversial
shelling of the Russian parliament building by tanks.

resulting in the death of between 50,000 and 100,000 people.
The Zapatista uprising  (1994) occurred when a large number of the Zapatista indigenous people of Mexico  formed the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation  and began an armed conflict with the Mexican government to protest against NAFT A. The uprising
lasted 12 days, bringing worldwide attention to the Zapatistas, and continued through the rest of the 1990s.

called "Irish dimension," the principle of consent  that the people of the island of Ireland had the exclusive right to solve the issues
between North and South by mutual consent.[16][17] The latter statement, which later would become one of the points of theEuropeYitzhak Rabin

parties linked with paramilitaries (such as Sinn Féin ) could take part in the talks so long as they abandoned violence.[19]
The IRA agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA  and the United

Northern Ireland . The 1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum  was held on 22 May 1998, with majority
approval.[20]

The 1990s saw a trend in frequent and more devastating natural disasters, breaking many previous records. Although the
1990s was designated by the United Nations as an International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction  as part of its
program to prevent losses due to disas ters, disasters would go on to cause a record-breaking US$608 billion worth of
damage—more than the past four decades combined.[38]
The most prominent natural disasters of the decade include: Hurricane Andrew  striking South Florida in
August 1992, the crippling super storm  of March 1993 along the Eastern Seaboard , the devastating 1994
Northridge earthquake  in Los Angeles, the Great Hanshin earthquake  in Kobe , Japan in January 1995, the Blizzard of 1996  in

Many countries, institutions, companies , and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s. High-income countries such as the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South  Korea, and Western Europe experienced steady economic growth
for much of the decade during the Great Mod eration . However , in the former Soviet Union , GDP  decreased as their economies restructured to
produce goods they needed, and some capital flight  occurred.

North America
The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United
States and Canada, largely because of the unexpected
advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries . The US and Canadian
economies experienced their longest period of peacetime economic expansion, beginning in
1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher
productivity overall. The New York Stock Exchange  stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999
to 2001.
After the 1992 boom of the US stock market , Alan Greenspan  coined the phrase " irrational
exuberance ", a reference to the overenthusiasm of investors that typified the trading of this
period, and warned of overvaluation  of assets and the stock market generally .
The North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFT A), which phases out the trade barriers
between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, was signed into law by President Bill
Clinton .
Asia
In the People's Republic of China , the government announced the major privatization  of
state-owned industries in September 1997. China entered the 1990s in a turbulent period
due to the aftermath of both the Tiananmen Square Massacre  and hardline politicians '
efforts to rein in private enterprise  and attempt to revive old-fashioned propaganda
campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply , and the Chinese
leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism  in Europe. In 1992
Deng Xiaoping  travelled  to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize
faith in market economics  and stop the country's slide back into Maoism . Afterward, China
recovered and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade.
Despite this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and Communist Party  General Secretary
Jiang Zemin  launched a brutal crackdown against the Falun Gong  religious sect  in 1999.
Deng Xiaoping died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese
embassy  during the bombing of Serbia by NA TO forces , which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the
Los Alamos Nuclear Facility .
Financial crisis  hits East and Southeast Asian  countries between 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic
development, which continues into 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.
In Japan , after three decades of economic growth  put them in second place in the world's economies, the county experienced an
economic downturn  after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century , ending the seemingly
unlimited prosperity that the country had previously enjoyed.
Less af fluent nations such as India , Malaysia , and Vietnam  also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and
quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold W ar was beginning. However , there was also the
continuation of terrorism in Third W orld regions that were once the "frontlines" for American and Soviet foreign politics,
particularly in Asia.
Europe
By 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's reforms were causing major inflation and
economic chaos. A coup  attempt by hardliners in August 1991 failed, marking the ef fective
end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence by 1991,
and Gorbachev resigned from of fice on Christmas. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had
ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation  was headed by Boris Yeltsin , and would face
severe economic dif ficulty . Oligarchs  took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors,
reducing almost half the country to poverty . With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the
support of  the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the
ruble  continued, and with heart  and alcohol troubles , Yeltsin stepped down from of fice on the
last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin .
Russian financial crisis  in the 1990s resulted in mass hyperinflation and prompted economic intervention from the International
Monetary Fund  and western countries to help Russia's economy recover .
The first McDonald's  restaurant opened in Moscow  in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and
future Russian President Boris Yeltsin attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist free market  economy and a
move towards adopting elements of Western culture .
Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and broader adoption of
trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy , with low petroleum  prices caused by
increased oil production. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the Cold W ar led to economic
development and higher living standards for many citizens.Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton share a

the massive 1995 general strikes in France  following a recession and the dif ficulties
associated with German reunification  led to sluggish growth in these countries. However , the
French and German  economies improved in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the
economies of Spain, Scandinavia  and former Eastern Bloc  countries accelerated at rapid
speed during the decade. Unemployment rates  were low due to many having experienced a
deep recession  at the start of the decade.
After the early 1990s recession , the United Kingdom  and Ireland  experienced rapid economic
growth and falling unemployment that continued throughout the decade. Economic growth
would continue until the Great Recession , marking the longest uninterrupted period of
economic growth in history .
Some Eastern European  economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland , Hungary , Czech Republic , Estonia , Latvia
and Lithuania  saw economic growth in the late 1990s.
With the creation of the European Union  (EU), there is freedom of movement  between member states, such as the 1992 and
1995 free trade agreements .
The Euro  is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out the former national
currencies of EU countries.[40]
South America
A Latin American common market, Mercosur , was established in 1991. Mercosur's origins are linked to the discussions for the
constitution of a regional economic market for Latin America, which go back to the treaty that established the Latin American
Free Trade Association in 1960, which was succeeded by the Latin American Integration Association in the 1980s.
The 1990s  were a revolutionary decade for digital technology . Between  1990 and 1997, household PC
ownership in the US rose from 15% to 35%.[42] Cell phones of the early-1990s and earlier ones were very
large, lacked extra features, and were used by only a few percent of the population of even the advanced
nations. Only a few million people used online services in 1990, and the World Wide Web, which would
have a significant impact on technology for many decades, had only just been invented. The first web
browser went online in 1993.[43] By 2001, more than 50% of some Western countries had Internet access,
and more than 25% had cell phone access.
On 6 August 1991, CERN , a pan-European organization for particle research, publicized the
new W orld Wide W eb project.[44] Although the basic applications and guidelines that make
the Internet possible had existed for almost two decades, the network did not gain a public
face until the 1990s.
Driven by mass adoption, consumer personal computer  specifications increased dramatically
during the 1990s, from 512 KB RAM 12 MHz Turbo XT s in 1990,[45] to 25–66 MHz 80486 -
class processor at the start of the popularization of the W orld Wide W eb mid-decade,[46] to
over 1 GHz CPUs with close to a gigabyte  of RAM by 2000.
Y2K spread fear throughout the United States and eventually the world in the last half of the
decade, particularly in 1999, about possible massive computer malfunctions on 1 January
2000. As a result, many people stocked up on supplies for fear of a worldwide disaster . After
significant ef fort to upgrade systems on the part of software engineers, no failures occurred when the
clocks rolled over into 2000.
Advancements in computer modems , ISDN , cable modems , and DSL led to faster connections to the
Internet.

1980, it was not until the Gulf W ar that the general public took notice, and others imitated CNN's non-stop news approach.[47]

The opening of the Channel Tunnel  between France and the United Kingdom saw the commencement by the three national railway companies of
Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, respectively SNCB/NMBS , SNCF  and British Rail  of the joint Eurostar  service.
On 14 November 1994 Eurostar services began between Waterloo
International  station in London,  Gare du Nord  in Paris and Brussels
South  in Brussels.[48][49][50] In 1995 Eurostar was achieving an
average end-to-end speed of 171.5 km/h (106.6 mph) between London
and Paris.[51] On 8 January 1996 Eurostar launched services from a
second railway station in the UK when Ashford International  was
opened.[52] Journey times between London and Brussels were reduced
by the opening of the High Speed 1  line on 14 December 1997.
The 1990s began with a recession  that dampened car sales. General Motors  suffered huge losses because of
an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality . Sales improved with the economy by the mid-
1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new Saturn  divis ion fared
well, Oldsmobile  fell sharply , and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.
Cars in the 1990s had a rounder , more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and
to a lesser extent later on.Software

minivans ) that were largely based on the aging K-car platform . In 1992, chairman  Lee Iacocca  retired, and the company began a remarkable
revival, introducing the new LH platfo rm and "Cab-Forward"  styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized Dodge Ram in
1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, Daimler -Benz  (the parent company of
Mercedes-Benz ) merged with Chrysler . The following year, it was decided to retire Plymouth , which had been on a long decline since the 1970s.
Ford  continued  to fare well in the 1990s, with the second  and third  generatio ns of the Ford Taurus being named the best-selling car in the United
States from  1992 to 1996. However , the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the Toyota Camry starting in 1997, which became the best-
selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer , with the first model being
sold in 1991. Ford's Explorer became the best-selling SUV  on the market, outselling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee.
Japanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The Honda Accord  vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling
car in the United States during the early decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands Lexus  and Infiniti  began car sales of 1990 model
year vehic les and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW  in the United States by 1991 and outsell Cadillac
and Linco ln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popul ar during the economic boom in the decade's second half. Many
manufacturers that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Fabric ation during the 1990s became gradually rounder and ovoid, the
Ford Taurus  and Mercury Sable  being some of the more extreme examp les. Safety features such as airbags  and shoulder belts became mandatory
equipment on new cars.
