1900s
The 1900s  (pronounced "nineteen-hundreds") was a decade  that began on January 1, 1900, and ended
on Decem ber 31, 1909. The Edwardian era (1901–19 10) cover s a similar span of time. The term
"nineteen-hundreds" is sometimes also used to mean the entire century from January 1, 1900, to
December 31, 1999 (the years beginning with "19").
The Scramble for Africa  continued , with the Orange Free State , South African Republic , Ashanti
Empire , Aro Confederacy , Sokoto Caliphate  and Kano Emirate  being conquered by the British Empire ,
alongside the French Empire conquering Borno , the German Empire conquering the Adamawa
Emirate , and the Portuguese Empire conquering the Ovam bo. Atrocities in the Congo Free State  were
committed by private companies and the Force Publique , with a resultant population decline[note 1] of 1
to 15 million. From  1904 to 1908, German colonial forces in South West Africa  led a campaign of
ethnic extermination and collective punishment , genociding 24,000 to 100,000 Hereros  and 10,000
Nama . The First Moroccan  and Bosnian crises  led to worsened tensions in Europe that would
ultimately lead to the World War I in the next decade. Cuba , Bulgaria , and Norway  became
independent.
The deadliest conventional war of this decade was the Russo-Japanese War, fought over rival imperial
ambitions in Manchuria  and the Korean Empire . Russia suffered a humiliating defeat in this conflict,
contributing to a growing domestic unrest which culminated in the Russian Revolution of 1905 .
Unconventional wars of similar scale include insurrections in the Philippines (1899–1913) , China
(1899–1901) , and Colombia (1899–19 02). Lesser conflicts include interstate wars such as the Second
Boer War (1899–1902), the Kuwaiti–Rashidi war (1900–1901), and the Saudi–Rashidi War (1903–
1907), as well as failed uprisings and revolutions in Portuguese Angola (1902–1904) , Rumelia (1903) ,
Ottoman Eastern Anatolia (1904) , Uruguay (1904) , French Madagascar (1905–1906) , Argentina
(1905) , Persia (1905–191 1), German East Africa  (1905–1907) , and Romania (1907) . A major famine
took place in China from 1906 to 1907 , possibly leading to 20–25 million deaths. This famine was
directly caused by the 1906 China flood s (April–October 1906), which hit the Huai River particularly
hard and destroyed both the summer and autumn harvest. The 1908 Messina earthquake  caused
75,000–82,000 deaths.
First-wave feminism  made advances, with universities being opened for women in Japan, Bulgaria,
Cuba, Russia, and Peru. In 1906, Finlan d granted women the right to vote,[2] the first European country to do so.[3] The foundation of the Women's Social and
Political Union by Emmeline Pankhurst  in 1903 led to the rise of the Suffragettes  in Great Britain and Ireland. In 1908, a revolutio n took place  in the Ottoman
Empire, where the Young Turks movement restored the Ottoman constitution  of 1876 , establishing the Second Constitution al Era. Subsequently , ethnic tensions
rose, and in 1909, up to 30,000 mainly Armenian civilians in Adana were massacred  by Muslim civilians.
The decade saw the widespread application of the internal combustion engine  including mass production of the automobile, as well as the introduction of the
typewriter . The Wright Flyer  performed the first recorded controlled, powered, sustained heavier than air flight on December 17, 1903. Reginald Fessenden  of
East Bolto n, Quebec , Canada made what  appeared to be the first audio radio broadcasts of entertainment and music ever made to a general audience. The first
huge succe ss of American cinema, as well as the largest experimental achievement to this point, was the 1903 film The Great Train Robbery , directed by Edwin
S. Porter, while the world's first feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang , was relea sed on December 26, 1906, in Melbourne , Australia. Popular books of this
decade included The Tale of Peter Rabbit  (1902) and Anne of Green Gables  (1908), which sold 45 million and 50 million copies respectively . Popular songs of
this decade include " Lift Every Voice and Sing " and " What Are They Doing in Heaven? ", which have been featured in 42 and 16 hymnals  respectively .
During the decade, the world population increased from 1.60 to 1.75 billion, with approximately 580 million births and 450 million deaths in total. As of
November 2024, 4 people from this decade remain alive (see List of oldest living people ), all of them wome n. The last living man from this decade was Juan
Vicente Pérez  (27 May 1909 – 2 April 2024).
There are several main varieties of how individual years of the decade are pronounced. Using 1906 as an example, they are "nineteen-oh-six", "nineteen-six" ,
and "nine teen-aught-six". Which variety is most prominent depends somewhat on global region and generation. "Nineteen-oh-six" is the most common;
"nineteen-six" is less common. In American English , "nineteen-aught-six" is also recognized but not much used.
Estimates for the world population by 1900 vary from 1.563 to 1.710 billion.Pronunciation varieties

The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin  (BCG) immunization for tuberculosis  is first developed.
Widespread application of the internal combustion engine  including mass production of the automobile. Rudolf Diesel  demonstrated the diesel
engine  in the 1900 Exposition Universelle  (World's Fair) in Paris using peanut oil fuel (see biodiesel ). The Diesel engine takes the Grand Prix.
The exposition was attended by 50 million people.[27] The same year Wilhelm Maybach  designed an engine built at Daimler Motoren
Gesellschaft —following the specifications of Emil Jellinek —who required the engine to be named Daimler -Mercedes  after his daughter ,
Mercédès Jellinek . In 1902, the Mercedes 35 hp  automobiles with that engine were put into production by DMG.[28]
Wide popularity of home phonograph . "The market for home machines was created through technological innovation and pricing:
Phonographs, gramophones, and graphophones were cleverly adapted to run by spring-motors (you wound them up), rather than by messy
batteries or treadle mechanisms, while the musical records were adapted to reproduce loudly through a horn attachment. The cheap home
machines sold as the $10 Eagle graphophone and the $40 (later $30) Home phonograph in 1896, the $20 Zon-o-phone in 1898, the $3 V ictor
Toy in 1900, and so on. Records sold because their fidelity improved, mass production processes were soon developed, advertising worked,
and prices dropped from one and two dollars to around 35 cents.".[29][30] In 1907, a Victor Records  recording of Enrico Caruso  singing
Ruggero Leoncavallo 's "Vesti la giubba " becomes the first to sell a million copies.[31]
1899–1900 – Thomas Alva Edison  of Milan, Ohio , invents the nickel-alkaline storage battery . On May 27, 1901, Edison establishes the Edison
Storage Battery Company  to develop and manufacture them.[32] "It proved to be Edison's most dif ficult project, taking ten years to develop a
practical alkaline battery . By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery , the gasoline  powered car had so improved that electric
vehicles  were becoming increasingly less common, being used mainly as delivery vehicles  in cities. However , the Edison alkaline battery
proved useful for lighting railway cars  and signals , maritime buoys , and miners lamps . Unlike iron ore  mining with the Edison Ore-Milling
Company , the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely , and the storage battery eventually became Edison's
most profitable product. Further , Edison's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery ."[33]
1900 – The Brownie  camera  is invented; this was the beginning of the Eastman Kodak  company . The Brownie popularized low-cost
photography  and introduced the concept of the snapshot . The first Brownie was introduced in February 1900,[34]
1900 – The first zeppelin  flight occurs over Lake Constance  near Friedrichshafen , Germany on July 2,
1900.
1901 – First electric typewriter  is invented by George Canfield Blickensderfer of Erie, Pennsylvania . It was
part of a line of Blickensderfer typewriters , known for its portability .[35][36][37]
1901 – Wilhelm Kress  of Saint Petersburg , Russia  creates his Kress Drachenflieger  in Austria-Hungary .
Power was provided by a Daimler petrol engine driving two large auger -style two-bladed propellers, the
first attempt to use an internal combustion engine to power a heavier-than-air aircraft.[38][39]
1901 – The first radio receiver  (successfully received a radio transmission). This receiver was developed
by Guglielmo Marconi . Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare
Strand , County W exford , Ireland in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu  in Cornwall  and Clifden  in
County Galway . He soon made the announcement that on December 12, 1901, using a 500-foot (150 m)
kite-supported antenna for reception, the message was received at Signal Hill  in St John 's, Newfoundland
(now part of Canada), signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The
distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles (3,500 km).
Heralded as a great scientific advance, there was—and continues to be—some skepticism about this claim,
partly because the signals had been heard faintly and sporadically . There was no independent confirmation
of the reported reception, and the transmissions, consisting of the Morse code  letter S sent repeatedly , were
difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise . (A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic
work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.)[40] The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.[41][42]
The first stage operated at a lower voltage and provided the energy for the second stage to spark at a higher
voltage.
1902 – Willis Carrier  of Angola, New York, invented the first indoor air conditioning . "He designed his spray
driven air conditioning system which controlled both temperature and humidity using a nozzle  originally
designed to spray insecticide . He built his "Apparatus for Treating Air" (U.S. Pat. #808897) which was
patented in 1906 and using chilled coils which not only controlled heat but could lower the humidity to as low
as 55%. The device was even able to adjust the humidity level to the desired setting creating what would
become the framework for the modern air conditioner . By adjusting the air movement and temperature level
to the refrigeration coils he was able to determine the size and capacity of the unit to match the need of his
customers. While Carrier was not the first to design a system like this his was much more stable, successful
and safer than other versions and took air conditioning out of the Dark Ages and into the realm of
science."[43]
1902/1906/1908 – Sir James Mackenzie  of Scone, Scotland , invented an early lie detector  or polygraph . MacKenzie's polygraph "could be
used to monitor the cardiovascular  responses of his patients by taking their pulse  and blood pressure .[44] He had developed an early version
of his device in the 1890s, but had Sebastian Shaw , a Lancashire  watchmaker , improve it further . "This instrument used a clockwork
mechanism for the paper-rolling and time-marker movements and it produced ink recordings of physiological functions that were easier to
acquire and to interpret. It has been written that the modern polygraph is really a modification of Dr . Mackenzie's clinical ink polygraph."[45] A
more modern and ef fective polygraph machine would be invented by John Larson in 1921.[46]TechnologyGilmore's second, larger plane

by Ford Motor Company beginning
production in 1903.

The first flight by Orville Wright made on
December 17, 1903.1902 – Georges Claude  invented the neon lamp . He applied an electrical discharge to a sealed tube of neon  gas, resulting in a red glow .
Claudes started working on neon tubes which could be put to use as ordinary light bulbs. His first public display of a neon lamp took place on
December 11, 1910, in Paris.[47] In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as advertising signs . They were introduced
to U.S. in 1923 when two large neon signs were bought by a Los Angeles Packard  car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made
neon advertising completely dif ferent from the competition.[48]
1902 – Teasmade , a device for making tea automatically , is patented on April 7, 1902, by gunsmith  Frank Clarke of Birmingham , England. He
called it "An Apparatus Whereby a Cup of Tea or Cof fee is Automatically Made" and it was later marketed as "A  Clock That Makes Tea!".
However , his original machine and all rights to it had been purchased from its actual inventor Albert E. Richardson , a clockmaker  from Ashton-
under-L yne. The device was commercially available by 1904.[49]
1902 – Lyman Gilmore  of Washington , United States is awarded a patent for a steam engine ,
intended for use in aerial vehicles. At the time he was living in Red Bluf f, California . At a later
date, Gilmore claimed to have incorporated his engine in "a monoplane  with a 32-foot
wingspan " and to have performed his debut flight in May 1902. While occasionally credited
with the first powered flight in aviation history , there is no supporting evidence for his
account.[50] While Gilmore was probably working on aeronautical experiments since the late
1890s and reportedly had correspondence with Samuel Pierpont Langley , there exists no
photo of his creations earlier than 1908.[51]
1902 – The Wright brothers  of Ohio , United States create the 1902 version of the Wright
Glider . It was the third free-flight glider built by them and tested at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina . This was the first of the brothers' gliders to
incorporate yaw control , and its design led directly to the 1903 Wright Flyer . The brothers designed the 1902 glider during the winter of 1901–
1902 at their home in Dayton, Ohio . They designed the wing based on data from extensive airfoil tests conducted on a homemade wind
tunnel . They built many of the components of the glider in Dayton, but they completed assembly at their Kitty Hawk camp in September 1902.
They began testing on September 19. Over the next five weeks, they made between 700 and 1000 glide flights (as estimated by the brothers,
who did not keep detailed records of these tests). The longest of these was 622.5 ft (189.7 m) in 26 seconds. "In its final form, the 1902
Wright glider was the world's first fully controllable aircraft."[52][53]
1903 – Ford Motor Company  produces its first car – the Ford Model A.
1903 – Richard Pearse  of New Zealand supposedly successfully flew
and landed a powered heavier-than-air machine on March 31, 1903[54]
Verifiable eyewitnesses describe Pearse crashing into a hedge on two
separate occasions during 1903. His monoplane must have risen to a
height of at least three metres on each occasion. Good evidence exists
that on March 31, 1903, Pearse achieved a powered, though poorly
controlled, flight of several hundred metres. Pearse himself said that he
had made a powered takeof f, "but at too low a speed for [his] controls to
work". However , he remained airborne until he crashed into the hedge at
the end of the field.[55][56]
1903 – Karl Jatho  of Germany  performs a series of flights at V ahrenwalder Heide, near Hanover ,
between August and November , 1903. Using first a pusher triplane , then a biplane . "His longest flight,
however , was only 60 meters at 3–4 meters altitude." He then quit his ef forts, noting his motor was too
weak to make longer or higher flights.[57] The plane was equipped with a single-cylinder 10 hp (7.5 kW) Buchet engine driving a two-bladed
pusher propeller and made hops of up to 200 ft (61 m), flying up to 10 ft (3.0 m) high. In comparison, Orville W right's first controlled flight four
months later was of 36 m (118 ft) in 12 seconds although Wilbur flew 59 seconds and 852 ft (260 m) later that same day . Either way Jatho
managed to fly a powered heavier-than-air machine earlier than his American counterparts.[58]
1903 – Mary Anderson  invented windshield wipers . In November 1903 Anderson was granted her first patent[59] for an automatic car window
cleaning device controlled inside the car , called the windshield wiper .[60] Her device consisted of a lever and a swinging arm with a rubber
blade. The lever could be operated from inside a vehicle to cause the spring-loaded arm to move back and forth across the windshield.
Similar devices had been made earlier , but Anderson's was the first to be ef fective.[61]
1903 – The Wright brothers  fly at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina . Their airplane, the Wright Flyer ,
performed the first recorded controlled, powered, sustained heavier than air flight on December 17,
1903. In the day's fourth flight, Wilbur W right flew 279 meters (915 feet) in 59 seconds. First three
flights were approximately 120, 175, and 200 ft (61 m), respectively . The W rights laid particular stress
on fully and accurately describing all the requirements for controlled, powered flight and put them into
use in an aircraft which took of f from a level launching rail, with the aid of a headwind to achieve
sufficient airspeed before reaching the end of the rail.[62] It is one of the various candidates regarded
as the first flying machine.
1904 – SS Haimun  sends its first news story on March 15, 1904.[63] It was a Chinese steamer ship
commanded by war correspondent  Lionel James  in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese W ar for The
Times . It is the first known instance of a "press boat" dedicated to war correspondence during naval
battles. The recent advent of wireless telegraphy  meant that reporters were no longer limited to
submitting their stories from land-based of fices, and The Times spent 74 days outfitting and equipping
the ship,[64] installing a De Forest transmitter  aboard the ship.[65]
1904–1914 – The Panama Canal  constructed by the United States in the territory of Panama , which had just gained independence  from
Colombia . The Canal is a 77 km (48 mi) ship canal  that joins the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and a key conduit for international
maritime trade. One of the largest and most dif ficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the canal had an enormous impact on shipping
between the two oceans, replacing the long and treacherous route via the Drake Passage  and Cape Horn  at the southernmost tip of South
America. A ship sailing from New York to San Francisco  via the canal travels 9,500 km (5,900 mi), well under half the 22,500 km (14,000 mi)
route around Cape Horn.[66] The project starts on May 4, 1904, known as Acquisition Day . The United States government purchased all Canal
properties on the Isthmus of Panama  from the New Panama Canal Company , except the Panama Railroad .[67] The project begun under the
administration of Theodore Roosevelt , continued in that of William Howard Taft and completed in that of Woodrow Wilson .[68][69] The Chief
engineers were John Frank Stevens  and George W ashington Goethals[70][71]
1904 – The Welte-Mignon  reproducing piano  is created by Edwin W elte and Karl Bockisch. Both employed by the "Michael W elte und Söhne"
firm of Freiburg im Breisgau , Germany . "It automatically replayed the tempo, phrasing, dynamics and pedalling of a particular performance,
and not just the notes of the music, as was the case with other player pianos of the time." In September , 1904, the Mignon was demonstrated
in the Leipzig Trade Fair . In March, 1905 it became better known when showcased "at the showrooms  of Hugo Popper , a manufacturer of roll-Construction work on the

the firms Feurich  and Steinway & Sons .[72]
1904 – Benjamin Holt  of the Holt Manufacturing Company  invents one of the first practical continuous tracks
for use in tractors . While the date of invention was reportedly November 24, 1904, Holt would not receive a
patent until December , 1907.[73]
1905 – John Joseph Montgomery  of California , United States designs tandem-wing gliders . His pilot Daniel
Maloney  performs a number of public exhibitions of high altitude flights in March and April 1905 in the Santa
Clara, California , area. These flights received national media attention and demonstrated superior control of
the design, with launches as high as 4,000 feet (1,200 m) and landings made at predetermined locations.
The gliders were launched from balloons.[74][75]
1905 – The W right Brothers introduce their Wright Flyer III . On October 5, 1905, Wilbur flew 24 miles (39 km)
in 39 minutes 23 seconds,[76] longer than the total duration of all the flights of 1903  and 1904 . Ending with a
safe landing when the fuel ran out. The flight was seen by a number of people, including several invited
friends, their father Milton, and neighboring farmers.[77] Four days later , they wrote to the United States
Secretary of W ar William Howard Taft, offering to sell the world's first practical fixed-wing aircraft.
1906 – The Gabel Automatic Entertainer , an early jukebox -like machine, is invented by John Gabel. It is the
first such device to play a series of gramophone records. "The Automatic Entertainer with 24 selections, was produced and patented by the
John Gabel owned company in Chicago. The first model (constructed in 1905) was produced in 1906 with an exposed 40 inch horn (102 cm)
on top, and it is today often considered the real father of the modern multi-selection disc-playing phonographs. John Gabel and his company
did in fact receive a special prize at the Pan-Pacific Exposition  for the Automatic Entertainer ."[78][79]
1906 – The Victor Talking Machine Company  releases the Victrola , the most popular gramophone  model until
the late 1920s.[80] The V ictrola is also the first playback  machine containing an internal horn.[81] Victor also
erects the world's largest illuminated billboard at the time, on Broadway  in New York City , to advertise the
company's records.[82]
1906 – Traian V uia of Romania  takes of f with his "T raian V uia 1", an early monoplane . His flight was
performed in Montesson  near Paris and was about 12 meters long.[83]
1906 – Jacob Ellehammer  of Denmark constructs the Ellehammer semi-biplane . In this machine, he made a
tethered flight on September 12, 1906, becoming the second European to make a powered flight.[84][85][86]
1906 – Alberto Santos-Dumont  and his Santos-Dumont 14-bis  make the first public flight of an airplane  on
October 23, 1906, in Paris. The flying machine was the first fixed-wing aircraft of ficially witnessed to take of f,
fly, and land. Santos Dumont is considered the "Father of Aviation" in his country of birth, Brazil .[87] His flight is the first to have been certified
by the Aéro-Club de France  and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale  (FAI).[88][89] On November 12, 1906, Santos Dumont succeeded
in setting the first world record recognized by the Aero-Club De France by flying 220 metres in less than 22 seconds.[90]
1906 – Sound radio broadcasting  was invented by Reginald Fessenden  and Lee De Forest . Fessenden and Ernst Alexanderson  developed a
high-frequency alternator -transmitters, an improvement on an already existing device. The improved model operated at a transmitting
frequency of approximately 50 kHz, although with far less power than Fessenden's rotary-spark transmitters. The alternator-transmitter
achieved the goal of transmitting quality audio signals, but the lack of any way to amplify the signals meant they were somewhat weak. On
December 21, 1906, Fessenden made an extensive demonstration of the new alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, showing its utility for point-
to-point wireless telephony , including interconnecting his stations to the wire telephone network. A detailed review of this demonstration
appeared in The American T elephone Journal .[91] Meanwhile, De Forest had developed the Audion tube  an electronic amplifier  device. He
received a patent in January , 1907.[92] "DeForest's audion vacuum tube was the key component of all radio, telephone, radar , television, and
computer systems before the invention of the transistor in 1947."[93]
1906 – Reginald Fessenden  of East Bolton, Quebec , Canada made what appear to be the first audio radio broadcasts of entertainment and
music ever made to a general audience. (Beginning in 1904, the United States Navy  had broadcast daily time signals and weather reports,
but these employed spark-gap transmitters , transmitting in Morse code ). On the evening of December 24, 1906 ( Christmas Eve ), Fessenden
used the alternator-transmitter to send out a short program from Brant Rock , Plymouth County , Massachusetts . It included a phonograph
record of Ombra mai fù  (Largo) by George Frideric Handel , followed by Fessenden himself playing the song O Holy Night  on the violin .
Finishing with reading a passage from the Bible : 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will' ( Gospel of Luke  2:14).
On December 31, New Year's Eve , a second short program was broadcast. The main audience for both these transmissions was an unknown
number of shipboard radio operators along the East Coast of the United States . Fessenden claimed that the Christmas Eve broadcast had
been heard "as far down" as Norfolk, V irginia , while the New Year Eve's broadcast had reached places in the Caribbean. Although now seen
as a landmark, these two broadcasts were barely noticed at the time and soon forgotten— the only first-hand account appears to be a letter
Fessenden wrote on January 29, 1932, to his former associate, Samuel M. Kinter .[94][95]
1907 – The Autochrome Lumière  which was patented in 1903 becomes the first commercial color
photography process.
1907 – Thomas Edison  invented the "Universal Electric Motor" which made it possible to operate dictation
machines , etc. on all lighting circuits.[96]
1907 – The Photostat machine  begins the modern era of document imaging. The Photostat machine was
invented in Kansas City , Kansas , United States by Oscar Gregory in 1907, and the Photostat Corporation
was incorporated in Rhode Island  in 1911. "Rectigraph and Photostat machines (Plates 40–42) combined
a large camera and a developing machine and used sensitized paper furnished in 350-foot rolls. "The
prints are made direct on sensitized paper , no negative, plate or film intervening. The usual exposure is
ten seconds. After the exposure has been made the paper is cut of f and carried underneath the exposure
chamber to the developing bath, where it remains for 35 seconds, and is then drawn into a fixing bath.
While one print is being developed or fixed, another exposure can be made. When the copies are
removed from the fixing bath, they are allowed to dry by exposure to the air , or may be run through a
drying machine. The first print taken from the original is a 'black' print; the whites in the original are black
and the blacks, white. (Plate 43) A white 'positive' print of the original is made by rephotographing the
black print. As many positives as required may be made by continuing to photograph the black print." (The
American Digest of Business Machines, 1924.) Du Pont Co. files include black prints of graphs dating
from 1909, and the company acquired a Photostat machine in 1912. ... A 1914 Rectigraph ad stated that the U.S. government had been using
Rectigraphs for four years and stated that the machines were being used by insurance companies and abstract and title companies. ... In
1911, a Photostat machine was $500."[97][98]
1908 – Henry Ford  of the Ford Motor Company  introduces the Ford Model T. The first production Model T was built on September 27, 1908,
at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant  in Detroit . It is generally regarded as the first af fordable automobile, the car that "put America on wheels";Ford Model T set 1908 as the historic
year that the automobile came into
popular usage as it is generally regarded
as the first affordable automobile.

individual hand crafting, as well as the concept of paying the workers a wage proportionate to the cost
of the car , so that they would provide a ready made market.[99]
1909 – Leo Baekeland  of Sint-Martens-Latem , Belgium of ficially announces his creation of Bakelite .

The best selling books of the decade were Anne of Green Gables (1908) and The Tale of Peter Rabbit  (1902), which sold 50
million[104] and 45 million[105] copies respectively . Serbian writers  used the Belgrade  literary style, an Ekavian  writing form which
set basis for the later standardization of the Serbian language. Theodor Herzl , the founder of political Zionism , published The Old
New Land  in 1902, outlining Herzl's vision for a Jewish state in the Land of Israel .

Howland Kenney's recent and welcome Recorded Music in
American Life: The Phonograph and Popular Memory , 1890–1945
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999). Much of the
technocentric focus of literature on the phonograph (a focus
Kenney's cultural history finally shifts) may derive from the interests
of collectors, for whom I have the utmost respect. In the interest of
simplicity , I am going to use the eventual American generic,
"phonograph," for the graphophone and gramophone as well as the
phonograph. Of course in Britain and much of the postcolonial
world, the generic is "gramophone.""
