2000s
The 2000s  (pronounced "two-thousands"; shortened to the '00s and known as the aughts  or
noughties ) was a decade  that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.
The early part of the decade saw the long-predicted breakthrough of economic giants in Asia, like
India  and China , which had double-digit growth during  nearly the whole decade. It is also benefited
from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly
dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emer ging economies with developed countries
sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in
energy and food price s at the end of the decade. The economic  developments in the latter third of the
decade were dominated by a worldwide  economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing
and credit  in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other
financial institutions . The outbreak of this global financial crisis  sparked a global recession , beginning
in the United States and af fecting most of the industrialized world.
The decade saw the rise of the Internet , which grew from covering 6.7% to 25.7% of the world
population. This contributed to globalization  during the decade, which allowed faster communication
among people around the world;[1][2][3][4][5] social netw orking sites arose as a new way for people to
stay in touch from distant locations, as long as they had internet access. Myspace  was the most popul ar
social networking website until June 2009, when Facebook overtook it in number of American users.
Email  continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace "snail mail" as the primary
way of sending letters and other messag es to people in distant locations. Google , YouTube, Ask.com
and Wikipedia  emerged to become among the top 10 most popular websites. Amazon  overtook eBay
as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL  significantly declined in popularity throughout the
decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite  and
Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN  fell from the secon d to sixth most popular site, though it
quadrupled its monthly visits. Yahoo!  main tained relatively stable popularity , remaining the most
popular website for most of the decade.
The war on terror  and War in Afghanistan  began after the September 11 attacks  in 2001. The
International Criminal Court  was form ed in 2002. In 2003, a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq,
and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein 's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party  in
Iraq. Al-Qaeda  and affiliated Islamist  militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade.
The Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars
that ended included the Algerian Civil War, the Angolan Civil War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the
Sri Lankan Civil War. Wars that began included the conflict in the Niger Delta , the Houthi insur gency , and the Mexican drug war .
Climate change  and global warming  became common concerns in the 2000 s. Prediction tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored
organizations such as the IPCC  gaine d influence, and studies such as the Stern Revi ew influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of
countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorologic al Organization  (WMO)
announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in
this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the NASA  and the NOAA . Major natural disasters included Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and earthquakes in
Pakistan  and China  in 2005 and 2008, respectively . The deadliest natural disaster[a] and most powerful earthquake of the 21st century occurred in 2004 when a
9.1–9.3 Mw earthquake and its subsequent tsunami  struck multiple nations in the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people.[6]
Usage of computer -generated imagery  became more widespread in films produced during the 2000s, especially with the success of 2001's Shrek and 2003 's
Finding Nemo, the latter  becoming  the best-selling DVD  of all time. Anime films gained more exposure outside Japan with the release of Spirited Away. 2009's
Avatar  became the highest-grossing film. Documen tary and mockumentary  films, such as March of the Penguins , Super Size Me, Borat  and Surf's Up, were
popular in the 2000 s. 2004's Fahr enheit 9/11 by Michael Moore  was the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular , and
conversion to digital cinema  started. Video game  consoles released in this decade included the PlayStation 2, Xbox , GameCube , Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox
360; while portable video game consoles included the Game Boy Advance , Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable . Wii Sports  was the decade's best-selling
console video game, while New Super Mario Bros. was the decade's best-selling portable video game. J. K. Rowling  was the best-selling author in the decade
overall thanks to the Harry Potter  book series, althoug h she did not pen the best-selling individual book, being second to The Da Vinci Code .[7] Eminem  was
named the music artist of the decade by Billboar d.
During this decade, the world population grew from 6.1 to 6.9 billion people. Approximately 1.35 billion people were born, and 550 million people died.[8]
Orthographically , the decade can be written as the "2000s" or the "'00s". In the English-speaking world, a name for the decade wasn't immediately  accepted as
it had been for other decades such as the 1980s  and 1990s  ('80s, '90s).[9][10][11][12][13]
The aughts  (American English )[14][15][16] or noughties  (British English )[17][18] arise from the words aught  and nought  respectively , both meaning zero. The
noughties  became a common name for the decade in the United Kingdom[19][20][21][22][23] and in New Zealand and Australia.[24][25]
Although use of the word aught  to refer to zero is not widespread in the United States, the use of aughts  to identify the decade became common there.[26][27][28]Name for  the decadeThe World Trade Center in

The war on terror  and War in Afghanistan  began after the September 11 attacks  in 2001.[37][38] The International Crimin al Court  was formed in 2002. In 2003 a
United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq War led to the end of Saddam Hussein 's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda  and
affiliated Islamist  milit ant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts inclu ded the 2004 Madrid train bombings , 7/7 London bombings  in
2005, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks  related to al-Qaeda. The European Union  expanded its sanctions amid Iran's failure to comply with its transparency
obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and United Nations resolutions .
The war on terror generated extreme controversy  around the world, with questions regarding the justification for certain U.S. actions leading to a loss of
support for the American government, both in and outside the United States.[39] The additional armed conflict occurred in the Middle East, including between
Israel  and Hezbollah , then with Israel and Hamas . The most  significant loss of life due to natural disasters  came from  the 2004 India n Ocean earthquake , which
caused a tsunami  that killed around one quarter -million people and displaced well over a million others.
The most prominent terrorist attacks  committed against the civilian population during the decade include:
September 11 attacks  in New York City ; Washington, D.C. ; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania  (2,977 killed)
2001 anthrax attacks  in the United States (5 killed, 17 infected)
2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis  in Moscow , Russia (171 killed)
2002 Bali bombings  in Bali, Indonesia (202 killed)
2003 Casablanca bombings  in Casablanca , Morocco  (45 killed)
2003 Istanbul bombings  in Istanbul, Turkey (57 killed)
2004 Madrid train bombings  (192 killed)
2004 Beslan school hostage crisis  (334 killed)
2005 London bombings  (56 killed)
2007 Yazidi communities bombings  (796 killed)
2008 Mumbai attacks  (175 killed)
2009 Boko Haram uprising  (1000+ killed)
The most prominent armed conflicts  of the decade include:
War on terror  (2001–present) – refers to several ideological , military , and diplomatic campaigns aimed at putting an end to international
terrorism  by preventing groups defined by the U.S. and its allies as terrorist  (mostly Islamist  groups such as al-Qaeda , Hezbollah , and
Hamas ) from posing a threat to the U.S. and its allies, and by putting an end to state sponsorship of terrorism . The campaigns were launched
by the United States, with support from NATO and other allies, following the September 11 attacks  that were carried out by al-Qaeda. Today
the term has become mostly associated with Bush administration-led wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq.
War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)  – In 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy , Spain, Canada, and Australia invaded
Afghanistan  seeking to oust the Taliban  and find al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden . In 2011, the US government claimed Navy
Seals  had killed Bin Laden and buried his body at sea. Fatalities of coalition troops: 1,553 (2001 to 2009).[40]Demographics

invaded  and occupied Iraq. Claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction  at its disposal were
later found to be unproven.[41] The war , which ended the rule of Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath Party , also
led to violence against the coalition forces and between many Sunni  and Shia Iraqi groups and al-
Qaeda operations in Iraq . Casualties of the Iraq W ar: Approximately 110,600 between March 2003 to
April 2009. Hussein was eventually sentenced to death and hanged on December 30, 2006.
Arab–Israeli conflict  (1948 – present)
2006 Lebanon W ar (summer 2006) – took place in southern Lebanon  and northern Israel . The
principal parties were Hezbollah  paramilitary forces and the Israeli military . The war that began as a
military operation in response to the abduction of two Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah
gradually strengthened and became a wider confrontation.
Israeli–Palestinian conflict  (Early 20th century – present)
Second Intifada  (2000–2005) – After the signing of the Oslo Accords  failed to bring about a
Palestinian state , in September 2000, the Second Intifada  (uprising) broke out, a period of
intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day . As a
result of the significant increase of suicide bombing attacks within Israeli population centers during
the first years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada ,[42] in June 2002 Israel began the construction of the West
Bank Fence  along the Green Line  border arguing that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli
civilians from Palestinian terrorism . The significantly reduced number of incidents of suicide
bombings from 2002 to 2005 has been partly attributed to the barrier .[43] The barrier's construction,
which has been highly controversial, became a significant issue of contention between the two
sides. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among
combatants and among civilians – The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated
to be 5,500 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreign citizens.[44] Many
Palestinians consider the Second Intifada to be a legitimate war of national liberation against
foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[45]
Gaza W ar (2008–2009)  – the frequent Hamas  Qassam rocket  and mortar  fire launched from within
civilian population centers in Gaza  towards the Israeli southern civilian communities led to an
Israeli military operation  in Gaza, which had the stated aim of reducing the Hamas rocket attacks
and stopping the arms smuggling into the Gaza Strip. Throughout the conflict, Hamas further
intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, hitting civilian targets and reaching major
Israeli cities Beersheba  and Ashdod , for the first time. The intense urban warfare  in densely
populated Gaza  combined with the use of massive firepower by the Israeli side[46] and the
intensified Hamas rocket attacks towards populated Israeli civilian targets led to a high toll on the
Palestinian side and among civilians.[47]
The Second Congo W ar (1998–2003) – took place mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The
widest interstate war in modern African history , it directly involved nine African nations, as well as about
twenty armed groups. It earned the epithet  of "Africa's W orld W ar" and the "Great W ar of Africa." An
estimated 3.8 million people died, mostly from starvation and disease brought about by the deadliest
conflict since W orld W ar II. Millions more were displaced  from their homes or sought asylum  in
neighboring countries.
Russo-Georgian W ar (2008) – Russia invaded Georgia  in response to Georgian aggression towards
civilians and attack on South Ossetia. Both Russia and Georgia were condemned internationally for their
actions.
The Second Chechen W ar (1999–2000) – the war was launched by the Russia  on August 26, 1999, in response to the war in Dagestan  and
the 1999 Russian apartment bombings , which were blamed on the Chechens . During the war , Russian forces largely recaptured the
separatist region of Chechnya .[48] The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the First Chechen W ar, in which the region gained de facto
independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria .
The Eritrean–Ethiopian W ar came to a close in 2000.
Kivu conflict  (2004–2009) – armed conflict between the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  (FARDC) and the Hutu Power  group
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda  (FDLR).
2009 Boko Haram uprising  – an armed conflict between Boko Haram , a militant Islamist  group, and Nigerian  security forces.
War in Darfur  (2003–2020) – an armed conflict in the Darfur  region of western Sudan . The conflict began
when the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Darfur
took up arms, accusing the government of oppressing black Africans in favor of Arabs. One side was
composed mainly of the Sudanese military  and the Sudanese militia  group Janjaweed , recruited mostly
from the Afro-Arab  Abbala tribes of the northern Rizeigat  region in Sudan. The other side was made up of
rebel groups, notably the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army  and the Justice and Equality Movement ,
recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa , and Masalit  ethnic groups. Millions of people
were displaced from their homes during the conflict.[49] There are various estimates on the number of
human casualties  – Sudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 19,500 civilians[50] while certain
non-governmental organizations, such as the Coalition for International Justice , claim that over 400,000
people have been killed during the conflict.[51] Former U.S. President  George W . Bush  called the events
in Darfur a genocide during his presidency .[52][53][54] The United States Congress  unanimously passed
House Concurrent Resolution 467, which declared the situation in Darfur a state-sponsored genocide by
the Janjaweed .[55] In 2008, the International Criminal Court  charged Omar al-Bashir  with genocide  for his
role in the W ar in Darfur .[56][57][58][59]
Mexican drug war  (2006–present) – an armed conflict fought between rival drug cartels  and the Mexican Armed Forces . Although Mexican
drug cartels, or drug traf ficking organizations, have existed for quite some time, they have become more powerful since the demise of
Colombia's Cali and Medellín  cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market  in the United
States.[60] Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for
control of the traf ficking routes into the United States.[61][62][63] Roughly more than 16,851 people in total were killed between December
2006 until November 2009.[64]Civil wars and guerrilla warsDarfur refugee camp in Chad

Naxalite movement is active (2007)In India, Naxalite–Maoist insurgency  (1967–present) has grown alarmingly with attacks such as April 2010
Maoist attack in Dantewada , Jnaneswari Express train derailment , and Rafiganj train disaster . Naxalites
are a group of far-left radical communists, supportive of Maoist political sentiment and ideology . It is
presently the longest continuously active conflict  worldwide. In 2006 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
called the Naxalites "The single biggest internal security challenge ever faced by our country ."[65] In 2009,
he said the country was "losing the battle against Maoist rebels".[66] According to standard definitions the
Naxalite –Maoist  insurgency is an ongoing conflict[67] between Maoist groups, known as Naxalites or
Naxals, and the Indian government.[65] On April 6, 2010, Maoist rebels killed 75 security forces in a jungle
ambush  in central India in the worst-ever massacre of security forces by the insurgents. On the same day ,
Gopal, a top Maoist leader , said the attack was a "direct consequence" of the government's Operation
Green Hunt  offensive. This raised some voices of use of Indian Air Force against Naxalites, which were,
however , declined, citing "W e can't use oppressive force against our own people".[68]
The Colombian conflict  continues causing deaths and terror in Colombia . Beginning in 1964, the FARC
and ELN narcoterrorist groups were taking control of rural areas of the country by the beginning of the
decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the
State would lose the war against guerrillas. However , after the failure of the peace process and the
activation of Plan Colombia , Álvaro Uribe  was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on
terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The AUC
paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The Popular
Liberation Army  demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, FARC  has been weakened and
most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the
decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling
themselves " Aguilas Negras ". Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the
country , narcoterrorism still causes pain in the country . Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field
of battle. Facebook has gained nationwide popularity and has become the birthplace of many civil
movements against narcoterrorism such as "Colombia Soy Yo" (I am Colombia) or "Fundación Un Millón
de Voces" (One Million V oices Foundation), responsible for the international protests against illegal
groups during the last years.
The Sierra Leone Civil W ar (1991–2002) came to an end when the Revolutionary United Front  (RUF)
finally laid down their arms. More than two million people were displaced from their homes because of the
conflict (well over one-third of the population) many of whom became refugees in neighboring countries. Tens of thousands were killed during
the conflict.[69]
The Sri Lankan Civil W ar (1983–2009) came to an end after the government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . Over 80,000
people were killed during the course of the conflict.[70]
Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  (2004–present) – an armed conflict between the Pakistani Armed Forces  and Islamic militants  made up
of local tribesmen, the Taliban , and foreign Mujahideen  (Holy W arriors). It began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the Pakistani Army's search
for al-Qaeda  members in Pakistan's mountainous Waziristan  area (in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ) escalated into armed
resistance by local tribesmen. The violence has displaced 3.44 million civilians[71] and led to more than 7,000 civilians being killed.[72]
The Angolan Civil W ar (1975–2002), once a major proxy conflict of the Cold W ar, the conflict ended after the anti-Communist organization
UNIT A disbanded to become a political party . By the time the 27-year conflict was formally brought to an end, an estimated 500,000 people
had been killed.[73]
Shia insurgency in Yemen  (2004–present) – a civil war in the Sada'a Governorate of Yemen . It began after the Shia Zaidiyyah  sect launched
an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government has accused Iran of directing and financing the insurgency .[74]
Thousands of rebels and civilians have been killed during the conflict.[75][76]
Somali Civil W ar (1991–present)
War in Somalia (2006–2009)  – involved largely Ethiopian  and Somali  Transitional Federal Government  (TFG) forces who fought against
the Somali Islamist  umbrella group , the Islamic Court Union  (ICU), and other af filiated militias for control of the country . The war spawned
pirates who hijacked hundreds of ships of f the coast of Somalia, holding ships and crew for ransom often for months (see also Piracy in
Somalia ). 1.9 million people were displaced from their homes during the conflict[77] and the number of civilian casualties during the
conflict is estimated at 16,724.[78]
Somali civil war (2009–present)  – involved largely the forces of the Somali Somali  Transitional Federal Government  (TFG) assisted by
African Union  peacekeeping troops, whom fought against various militant Islamist factions for control of the country . The violence has
displaced thousands of people residing in Mogadishu , the nation's capital. 1,739 people in total were killed between January 1, 2009, and
January 1, 2010.[79]
Conflict in the Niger Delta  (2004–present) – an ongoing conflict in the Niger Delta  region of Nigeria . The conflict was caused due to the
tensions between the foreign  oil corporations  and a number of the Niger Delta 's minority ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited,
particularly the Ogoni  and the Ijaw. The competition for oil wealth has led to an endless violence cycle between innumerable ethnic groups ,
causing the militarization  of nearly the entire region that was occupied by militia groups as well as Nigerian military  and the forces of the
Nigerian Police.
Algerian Civil W ar (1991–2002) – the conflict ef fectively ended with a government victory , following the surrender of the Islamic Salvation
Army  and the 2002 defeat of the Armed Islamic Group . It is estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed during the course of the
conflict.
Civil war in Chad  (1998–present)
Chadian Civil W ar (1998–2002)  – involved the Movement for Justice and Democracy in Chad  (MDJT) rebels that skirmished periodically
with government troops in the Tibesti region , resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties.
Chadian Civil W ar (2005–2010)  – involved Chadian  government forces and several Chadian rebel groups. The Government of Chad
estimated in January 2006 that 614 Chadian citizens had been killed in cross-border raids.[80] The fighting still continues despite several
attempts to reach agreements.
Nepalese Civil W ar (1996–2006) – the conflict ended with a peace agreement  was reached between the government and the Maoist party in
which it was set that the Maoists would take part in the new government in return for surrendering their weapons to the UN. It is estimated
that more than 12,700 people were killed during the course of the conflict.[81]
Second Liberian Civil W ar (1999–2003) – The conflict began in 1999 when a rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy
(LURD), with support from the Government of Guinea , took over northern Liberia  through a coup. In early 2003, a dif ferent rebel group, the
Movement for Democracy in Liberia , emerged in the south. As a result, by June–July 2003, president  Charles Taylor 's government controlled
only a third of the country . The capital Monrovia  was besieged  by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many
civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.2006 Thai coup d'état

Ituri conflict  (1999–2007) – a conflict fought between the Lendu  and Hema  ethnic groups in the Ituri region of northeastern Democratic
Republic of Congo  (DRC). While there have been many phases to the conflict, the most recent armed clashes ran from 1999 to 2003, with a
low-level conflict continuing until 2007. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the conflict and hundreds of thousands forced from their
homes.[82]
Central African Republic Bush W ar (2004–2007) – began with the rebellion by the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity  (UFDR) rebels, after
the current president of the Central African Republic , François Bozizé , seized power in a 2003 coup. The violence has displaced around
10,000 civilians and has led to hundreds of civilians being killed.
Afghan Civil W ar (1996–2001)  – an armed conflict that continued after the capture of Kabul  by the Taliban , in which the formation of the
Afghan Northern Alliance  attempted to oust the Taliban. It proved largely unsuccessful, as the Taliban continued to make gains and
eliminated much of the Alliance's leadership.
The most prominent coup d'état  of the decade include:
2000 overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  – after Slobodan Milošević
was accused by opposition figures of winning the 2000 election through electoral fraud, mass protests led
by the opposition movement Otpor!  pressure Slobodan Milošević  to resign. Milošević was later arrested in
2001 and sent to the Hague to face war crimes charges for his alleged involvement in war crimes of the
Yugoslav W ars.

The most significan t evolution of the 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China , whose GDP  grew
from 1.21 trillion to 5.1 trillion (in 2022 USD).[124] To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom (growing from 438.39 billion to 1.34
trillion)[125] whic h saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force.[126] The rapid catching-up of emer ging
economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices
at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with
the crisis in housing and credit  in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions.[127] The outbreak of
this global financial crisis  sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and af fecting most of the industrialized world.
A study by the W orld Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University  reports that the richest 1% of adults alone
owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three  richest people  possess more financial  assets than the lowest 48 nations combined.
The combined wealth of the "10 million dollar millionaires" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008.[128]
The sale of UK gold reserves, 1999–2002  was a policy pursued by HM Treasury  when gold prices were at their lowest in 20 years, following
an extended bear market . The period itself has been dubbed by some commentators as the Brown Bottom  or Brown's
Bottom .[129][130][131][132][133][134]
The perio d takes its name from Gordon Brown , the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer  (who later became  Prime Minister ), who decided to sell
approximately half of the UK's gold reserves  in a series of auctio ns. At the time, the UK's gold reserves were worth about US$6.5 billion, accounting for about
half of the UK's US$13 billion foreign currency  net reserves.[135]

future possible takeovers  and mergers , healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector , and moderate inflationary  numbers; fueling
speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates . Roughly on par  with the 2000 record when adjusted for inflation, this
represented the final high of the cyclical bull. The index closed 2007 at 13,264.82, a level it would not surpass for nearly five years.
Between 1999 and 2009, according to the World Bank  statistics for GDP:[140][141]
The world economy  by nominal GDP  almost doubled in size from U.S. $30.21 trillion in 1999 to U.S.
$58.23 trillion in 2009. This figure is not adjusted for inflation. By PPP, world GDP  rose 78%, according to
the IMF . But inflation adjusted nominal GDP  rose only 42%, according to IMF constant price growth
rates.[142] The following figures are not inflation adjusted nominal GDP  and should be interpreted with
extreme caution:
The United States (U.S. $14.26 trillion) retained its position of possessing the world's largest economy .
However , the size of its contribution to the total global economy dropped from 28.8% to 24.5% by nominal
price or a fall from 23.8% to 20.4% adjusted for purchasing power .
Japan (U.S. $5.07 trillion) retained its position of possessing the second largest economy in the world, but its contribution to the world
economy also shrank significantly from 14.5% to 8.7% by nominal price or a fall from 7.8% to 6.0% adjusted for purchasing power .
China (U.S. $4.98 trillion) went from being the sixth largest to the third largest economy , and in 2009 contributed to 8.6% of the world's
economy , up from 3.3% in 1999 by nominal price or a rise from 6.9% to 12.6% adjusted for purchasing power .
Germany (U.S. $3.35 trillion), France (U.S. $2.65 trillion), United Kingdom (U.S. $2.17 trillion) and Italy (U.S. $2.11 trillion) followed as the
4th, 5th, 6th and 7th largest economies, respectively in 2009.
Brazil (U.S. $1.57 trillion) retained its position as the 8th largest economy , followed by Spain (U.S. $1.46 trillion), which remained at 10th.
Other major economies included Canada (U.S. $1.34 trillion; 10th, down from 9th), India (U.S. $1.31 trillion; remaining at 11th from 12th),
Russia (U.S. $1.23 trillion; from 16th to 12th) Mexico (U.S. $875 billion; 14th, down from 11th), Australia (U.S. $925 billion; from 14th to 13th)
and South Korea (U.S. $832 billion; 15th, down from 13th).
In terms of purchasing power parity  in 2009, the ten largest economies were the United States (U.S. $14.26 trillion), China (U.S. $9.10
trillion), Japan (U.S. $4.14 trillion), India (U.S. $3.75 trillion), Germany (U.S. $2.98 trillion), Russia (U.S. $2.69 trillion), United Kingdom (U.S.
$2.26 trillion), France (U.S. $2.17 trillion), Brazil (U.S. $2.02 trillion), and Italy (U.S. $1.92 trillion).[143][144]
The average house price in the UK, increased by 132% between the fourth quarter of 2000, and 91% during the decade; but the average
salary increased only by 40%.[145]
The remov al of trade and investmen t barriers , the growth of domestic markets , artificially low currencies , the proliferation of
education , the rapid developm ent of high tech and information systems  industries  and the growth of the world econ omy lead to a
significant growth of offshore outsourcing  during the decade as many multinational corpo rations  significan tly increased
subcontracting  of manufacturing  (and increasingly , services ) across national boundaries in developing countries  and partic ularly
in China and India, due to many benefits  and mainl y because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the
world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of
this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated capital  and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the
United Arab Emirates , Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their minera l and energy resources that
global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which
had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by
countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result,
many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing , computer programm ing, and
technical support ) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially af fected.
While global trade  rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the WTO in 2001), there was little progress in the
multilateral trading system. International trade  continued to expan d during the decade as emer ging economies and developing
countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies.
However , global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make much progress, as member countries of the World Trade
Organization  did not succeed in finding agreements  to stretch the extent of free trade .[146] The Doha Round of negotiations,
launched in 2001 by the WTO to promote development, failed to be completed because of growing tensions between regional
areas. Nor did the Cancún Conference  in 2003 find a consensus on services trade[147] and agricultural subsidies .[148]
The comparative rise of China, India, and other developing countries also contri buted to their growing clout in international forums . In 2009, it was determined
that the G20, originally a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors, would replace the G8 as the main economic council.
2007 Chinese export recalls  – in 2007, a series of product recalls and import bans were imposed by the product safety institutions of the United States,
Canada , the European Union , Australia  and New Zealand  against products manufactured in and exported from the mainland  of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) because of numerous alleged consumer safety  issues.
Events in the confid ence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste , lipstick , and a ban on certain types of seafood . Also
included are reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, slated  to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse
consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy .
The decade was marked by two financial and economic crises. In 2001, the Dot-com bubble  burst, causing turmoil in financial markets and a decline in
economic activity  in the developed economies, in particul ar in the United States.[149] However , the impact of the crisis on the activity was limited thanks to the
intervention of the central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve  System. Indeed, Alan Gree nspan , leader of the Feder al Reserve until 2006, cut the interestEconomic growth in the world

As the Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates to favor economic growth, a housing bubble  began to appear in the
United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing  market caused a wave of loan paym ent
failures  in the U.S. The subsequent mortgage crisis  caused a global financial crisis , because the subprim e mortgages had
been securitized  and sold to interna tional banks and investment funds. Despite the extensive intervention of central
banks, including partial and total nationalization of major European banks,[152][153] the crisis of soverei gn debt became
particularly acute, first in Iceland , though as events of the early 2010s would show , it was not an isolated European
example. Economic activity was severely affected  around the world in 2008 and 2009,[154] with disastrous consequences
for carmakers .[155]
In 2007, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer  Gordon Brown , delivered his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor
before he moved into Number 10. Addressing financiers: "A new world order  has been created", Everyone needed to
follow the city's "great example", "an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age".[156]
Reactions of governments in all devel oped and developing countries against the economic slowdown were largely
inspired by keynesian economics . The end of the decade was characterized by a Keynesian resur gence ,[157] while the influence  and media popularity of left-
wing economists[158] Joseph Stiglitz  and Paul Krugman  (Nobel Prize recipi ents in 2001 and 2008, respectively) did not stop growing during the decade.[159]
Several international summits were organized to find solutions against the economic crisis and to impose greater control on the financial markets. The G20
became in 2008 and 2009 a major organization, as leaders of the member countries held two major summits in Washington in November 2008  and in London in
April 2009  to regulate the banking and financial sectors,[160] and also succeeding in coordinating their economic action and in avoiding protectionist reactions.
From the mid-1980s  to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel  of crude oil on NYMEX was generally
under $25/barrel. During 2003, the price  rose above $30, reached $60 by August 11, 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July
2008.[161] Commen tators attributed these price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States
Department of Energy and others showi ng a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, Middle East tension,
and oil price speculation.[162]
For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term
effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included North Korean  missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel
and Lebanon, worries over Iranian  nuclear plants in 2006 and Hurricane Katrina . By 2008 , such pressures appeared to
have an insignifican t impact on oil prices given the onset of the global reces sion. The recession caused demand for
energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However , it surged back in May 2009, bringing it
back to November 2008 levels.[163]
Many fast-growing economies through out the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing
demand for fossil fuels , which—along with fewer new petrole um finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil—forced
two other  trends: a soar in the price of petroleum  products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the
development of environmentally friendly technology  (known informally as "green" technolo gy). However , a side-ef fect of the
push by some industrial nations to "go green" and utilize biofuels  was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase
in the price of the same. It partially caused the 2007 food price crisis , which seriously affected the world's poorer nations with an
even more severe shortage of food.[164]
A common currency for most EU member states, the euro, was established electronically
in 1999, officially tying all the currenc ies of each participating nation to each other . The new currency was put into
circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided
not to join the euro (the United King dom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the EU undertook a major eastward
enlar gement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, Bulgaria and
Romania , joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.
The euro has since become the second largest reserve currency  and the second most traded currency in the world after
the US$.[165] As of October 2009 , with more than €790 billion in circulat ion, the euro was the currency with the highest
combined value of banknotes and coins in circulation  in the world, having surpassed the US$.[note 1]

Perelman was awarded the Fields Medal[167] for "his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and
geometric structure of the Ricci flow ." Perelman declined to accept the award or to appear at the congress , stating: "I'm not interested in
money or fame, I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo."[168] On December 22, 2006, the journal Science  recognized Perelman's
proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific " Breakthrough of the Year", the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.[169] The
Poincaré conjecture is one of the seven Millennium Problems  and the first to be solved.

Automotive navigation systems  become widely popular making it possible to direct vehicles to any destination in real-time as well as detect
traffic and suggest alternate routes with the use of GPS navigation devices .
Greater interest in future energy development  due to global warming  and the potential exhaustion of crude oil . Photovoltaics  increase in

The Hybrid vehicles  market, which became somewhat popular towards the middle of the decade, underwent major advances notably typified
by such cars as the Toyota Prius , Ford Escape , and the Honda Insight  though by December 2010 they accounted for less than 0.5% of the
world cars.
Many more computers and other technologies were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: Xenon HID headlights , GPS ,
DVD players , self-diagnosing systems, memory systems for car settings, back-up sensors and cameras, in-car media systems, MP3 player
compatibility , USB drive compatibility , keyless start and entry , satellite radio , voice-activation , cellphone connectivity , HUD  (Head-Up-Display)
and infrared cameras . In addition, more safety features were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: advanced pre-collision
safety systems , Backup cameras , Blind spot monitor , Adaptive cruise control , Adaptive headlamps , Automatic parking , Lane departure
warning systems  and the Advanced Automatic Collision Notification  system Onstar  (on all GM models).
The sale of Crossovers  (CUVs), a type of car-based unibody  sports utility vehicle , increased in the 2000s.[175] By 2006, the segment came
into strong visibility in the U.S., when crossover sales "made up more than 50% of the overall SUV market".[176]

The popularity of mobile phones and text messaging  surged in the 2000s in the W estern world. The
advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before, leading to
positive implications such as having the ability to receive information on the move. Nevertheless, it also
led to negative social implications such as " cyberbullying " and the rise of traf fic collisions caused by
drivers who were distracted as they were texting while driving .
Mobile internet , first launched in Japan with the i-mode  in 1999, became increasingly popular with people
in developed countries throughout the decade, thanks to improving cell phone capabilities and advances
in mobile telecommunications technology , such as 3G.
E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade. It began to replace " snail mail " (also known, more
neutrally , as paper mail , postal mail , land mail , or simply mail or post ) as the primary way of sending
letters and other messages to people in faraway locations, though it has been available since 1971.
Social networking sites  arose as a new way for people to stay in touch no matter where they are, as long
as they have an internet connection . The earliest social networking sites were Friendster , Myspace ,
Facebook , and Twitter  in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively . Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009
when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users.[177]
Smartphones , which combine mobile phones with the features of personal digital assistants  and portable media players , first emerged in the
1990s but did not become popular until the late 2000s. Smartphones are rich in features and often have high resolution touchscreens  and
web browsers . The first modern smartphone was the iPhone 2G . It was released in June 2007 in the United States , and in November 2007,
the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Portugal , Ireland  and Austria . It was the first smartphone to not include a physical keyboard, solely
utilizing a touch screen and a home button.
Due to the major success of broadband Internet connections, VoIP starts to gain popularity as a replacement for traditional telephone  lines.
In the 2000s, the Internet became a mainstay , strengthening its grip on Wester n society while becoming increasingly available in the developing world. The
share of the world population using the internet grew from 6.7% to 25.7%.[178]
A huge jump in broadband internet usage  globally – for example, from 6% of U.S. internet users in June
2000[179] to what one mid-decade study predicted would be 62% by 2010.[180] By February 2007, over
80% of U.S. Internet users were connected via broadband and broadband internet has been almost a
required standard for quality internet browsing.[181]
Wireless internet  became prominent by the end of the decade, as well as internet access in devices
besides computers, such as mobile phones and gaming consoles.
Email became a standard form of interpersonal written communication, with popular addresses available
to the public on Hotmail (now Outlook.com) , Gmail  and Yahoo! Mail .
Normalisation  became increasingly important as massive standardized corpora  and lexicons  of spoken and written language became widely
available to laypeople , just as documents from the paperless of fice were archived and retrieved with increasing ef ficiency using XML-basedTechnology

Computing and InternetThe rise of MP3 players,
downloadable music, and cellular
ringtones in the mid-2000s ended
the decade-long dominance that the

Peer-to-peer  technology gained massive popularity with file sharing  systems enabling users to share any audio, video and data files or
anything in digital format, as well as with applications which share real-time data, such as telephony  traffic.
VPNs  (virtual private networks) became likewise accessible to the general public, and data encryption remained a major issue for the stability
of web commerce.
Boom in music downloading and the use of data compression  to quickly transfer music over the Internet, with a corresponding rise of
portable digital audio players. As a result, the entertainment industry  struggled through the decade to find digital delivery systems for music,
movies, and other media that reduce copyright infringement  and preserve profit.
The USB flash drive  replaces the floppy disk  as the preferred form of low-capacity mobile data storage.
In February 2003, Dell announced floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on Dell Dimension  home computers, although they were still
available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM  add-on.[182] On January 29, 2007, PC W orld stated that only 2% of
the computers they sold contained built-in floppy disk  drives; once present stocks were exhausted, no more standard floppies would be
sold.[183]
During the decade, Windows 2000 , XP, Microsoft Of fice 2003 , Vista and Office 2007  (and later Windows 7 ) become the ubiquitous industry
standards  in personal computer software until the end of the decade, when Apple began to slowly gain market share. Windows ME  and
Microsoft Of fice XP  were also released during the decade.
With the advent of the Web 2.0 , dynamic technology became widely accessible, and by the mid-2000s, PHP and MySQL  became (with
Apache  and nginx ) the backbone of many sites, making programming knowledge unnecessary to publish to the web. Blogs, portals , and
wikis  become common electronic dissemination methods for professionals, amateurs, and businesses to conduct knowledge management
typified by success of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which launched on January 15, 2001, grew rapidly and became the largest and
most popular general reference work on the Internet[184][185] as well as the best known wiki in the world and the largest encyclopedia in the

Open-source software , such as the Linux  operating system, the Mozilla Firefox  web browser and VLC media player , gain ground.
Internet commerce  became standard for reservations; stock trading; promotion of music, arts, literature, and film; shopping; and other
activities.
During this decade certain websites and search engines became prominent worldwide as transmitters of goods, services and information.
Some of the most popular and successful online sites or search engines of the 2000s included Google , Yahoo! , Wikipedia, Amazon , eBay ,
MySpace, Facebook, Twitter , and YouTube.
More and more businesses began providing paperless  services, clients accessing bills and bank statements directly through a web interface .
In 2007, the fast food chain McDonald's  announced the introduction of free high speed wireless internet access at most of its 1,200
restaurants by the end of the year in a move which will make it the UK's biggest provider of such a service.[186]
Google , YouTube, Ask.com  and Wikipedia  emerged as popular  websites, becoming the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 9th most popula r websites by the end of the decade
respectively . Amazon  overtook eBay  as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. AOL  significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from
being the most popu lar website to no longer being within the top 10. Excite  and Lycos fell outside the top 10, and MSN  fell from the secon d to sixth most
popular site, though it quadrupled its monthly visits (going from 325 to 1.2 billion monthly visits). Yahoo!  maintained relatively stable popularity , remaining
the most popular website for most of the decade.[187]
GPS  (Global Positioning System) became very popular especially in the tracking of items or people, and
the use in cars (see Automotive navigation systems ). Games that utilized the system, such as
geocaching , emerged and became popular .
Green laser pointers[189] appeared on the market circa 2000, and are the most common type of DPSS
lasers (also called DPSSFD for "diode pumped solid state frequency-doubled").
In late 2004 and early 2005, came a significant increase in reported incidents linked to laser pointers  – see Lasers and
aviation safety . The wave of incidents may have been  triggered in part by "copycats" who read press accounts of laser
pointer incidents. In one case, David Banach of New Jersey was charged under federal Patriot Act anti-terrorism laws,
after he allegedly shone a laser pointer at aircraft.[190]
Chip and PIN  is the brand name adopted by the banking industries in the United Kingdom  and Ireland  for
the rollout of the EMV smart card payment system for credit, debit and ATM cards.
Chip and PIN was trialled in Northampton , England  from May 2003, and as a result was rolled out nationwide in the
United Kingdom in 2004 with advertisements in the press and national television touting the "Safety in Numbers"
slogan.
In 2009, Tesco  (a British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer) opened its first UK branch at which service robots were the
only option at the checkout, in Kingsley , Northampton  – its US chain, Fresh & Easy , already operates several branches like this.[191]
September 7, 2009, an EU watchdog warns of an "alarming increase" in cash machine fraud by organised criminal gangs across Europe
using sophisticated skimming technology , together with an explosion in ram-raiding attacks on ATMs.
ATM crime in Europe jumped to €485m (£423m) in 2008 following a 149% rise in attacks on cash machines. Gangs are turning to Bluetooth  wireless
technology to transmit card and personal identification number  (PIN) details to nearby laptops  and using increasingly sophisticated techniques to skim cards.
Portable laptops became popular during the late 2000s.
More conventional smash-and-grab attacks are also on the rise, says Enisa, the European Network and Information Security Agency . It reports  a 32% rise in
physical robberies on ATMs, ranging from ram raids to the use of rotary saws, blowtorches and diamond drills. It blames the increase on criminal gangs from
eastern Europe.[192]Popular websites

2009 – In Pope Benedict XVI 's third encyclical  Caritas in V eritate , he warns that a purely technocrat mindset where decisions are made only
on grounds of ef ficiency will not deliver true development. Technical decisions must not be divorced from ethics. Benedict discusses bioethics
and states that practices such as abortion, eugenics and euthanasia are morally hazardous and that accepting them can lead to greater
tolerance for various forms of moral degradation. He turns to another consequence of the technocratic mindset, the viewing of people's
personalities in purely psychological terms at the exclusion of the spiritual, which he says can lead to people feeling empty and abandoned
even in prosperous societies.
The decade saw further expansion of LGBTQ+ rights , with many European, Oceanic, and American countries recognizing civil unions and
partnerships and a number of countries extending civil marriage to same-sex couples. The Netherlands  was the first country in the world to
legalize same-sex marriage  in 2001. By the end of 2009, same-sex marriage  was legal and performed in 10 countries worldwide, although
only in some jurisdictions in Mexico  and the United States .
Population continued to grow in most countries, in particular in developing countries, though overall the rate slowed. According to United
Nations estimates, world population reached six billion in late 1999,[217] and continued to climb to 6.8 billion in late 2009.[218] In 2007 the
population of the United States reached 300 million inhabitants, and Japan's population peaked at 127 million before going into decline.[219]
In a 2003 memo to a staf f member , Britain's Charles, Prince of W ales wrote:
What is wrong with everyone nowadays? Why do they all seem to think they are qualified to do things far beyond their technical
capabilities? This is to do with the learning culture in schools as a consequence of a child-centred system that admits no failure.
People think they can all be pop stars, high court judges, brilliant TV personalities or infinitely more competent heads of state
without ever putting in the necessar y work or having natural ability . This is the result of social utopianism which believes humanity
can be genetically and socially engineered to contradict the lessons of history ...[220]
Obesity  is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of
the most serious public health problems of the 21st century .[221]
In 2001, 46.4% of people in sub-Saharan Africa  were living in extreme poverty .[222] Nearly half of all Indian children are undernourished,
however , even among the wealthiest fifth one third of children are malnourished.[223][224]
5 A Day is the name of a number of programs in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom  and Germany , to encourage the
consumption of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables  each day , following a recommendation by the World Health Organization  that
individuals consume at least 400 g of vegetables daily .[225]
The programme was introduced by the UK Department of Health in the winter of 2002–2003, and received some adverse media attention
because of the high and rising costs of fresh fruit and vegetables. After ten years, research suggested that few people were meeting the
target.[226]Miscellaneous

On December 3, 2003, New Zealand  passed legislation to progressively implement a smoking ban  in schools, school grounds, and
workplaces by December 2004.[227] On March 29, 2004, Ireland  implemented a nationwide ban on smoking in all workplaces. In Norway ,
similar legislation was put into force on June 1 the same year . Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in
2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into ef fect (the age limit for buying tobacco was also raised from 16
to 18 on October 1, 2007). From 2004 to 2009, the UK's Merseyside police of ficers, conducted 1,389 section 60 stop and searches (without

The number of antidepressants  prescribed by the NHS  in the United Kingdom almost doubled during one decade, authorities reported in
2010. In 2009, 39.1 million prescriptions for drugs to tackle depression were issued in England, compared with 20.1 million issued in
1999.[230]
In the United States a 2005 independent report stated that 11% of women and 5% of men in the non-institutionalized population (2002) take
antidepressants . The use of antidepressants in the United States doubled over one decade, from 1996 to 2005.[231]
Antidepressant drugs were prescribed to 13 million in 1996 and to 27 million people by 2005. In 2008, more than 164 million prescriptions
were written.[231]

Jamie Oliver , is a British chef, restaurateur , media personality , known for his food-focused television shows and cookbooks. In 2006, Oliver
began a formal campaign to ban unhealthy food in British schools and to get children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver's ef forts to bring
radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners , challenged the junk-food culture by showing
schools they could serve healthy , cost-ef ficient meals that kids enjoyed eating.[233] Jamie's ef forts brought the subject of school dinners to the
political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.[234]
In 2006, nearly 11 million Plastic surgery  procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures
performed in the United States has increased over 50 percent since the start of the century .[235]
In November 2006, the Of fice of Communications ( Ofcom ) announced that it would ban television advertisements for junk food before, during
and after television programming aimed at under-16s in the United Kingdom.[236] These regulations were originally outlined in a proposal
earlier in the year . This move has been criticized on both ends of the scale; while the Food and Drink Federation  labelled the ban "over the
top", others have said the restrictions do not go far enough (particularly due to the fact that soap operas  would be exempt from the ban).[237]
On April 1, 2007, junk food advertisements were banned from programmes aimed at four to nine-year-olds.[238] Such advertisements
broadcast during programmes "aimed at, or which would appeal to," ten to fifteen-year-olds will continue to be phased out over the coming
months,[239] with a full ban coming into ef fect on January 1, 2009.[238]

A 2009 study found a 30% increase in Chinese diabetes  over 7 years.[243]
AIDS  continued to expand during the decade, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa . New diseases of animal origin appeared for a short time, such
as the bird flu  in 2007.[244] Swine flu  was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization  in 2009.[245]
Climate change  and global warming  became household words in the 2000s . Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored
organisations such as the IPCC  gained influence, and studies such as the Stern report  influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of
countering climate change.
The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the World Meteorologic al Organization  (WMO) announced that the 2000s might
have been  the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade.[246][247] The NASA
and the NOAA  later echoed the WMO's findings.[248]
Major natural disasters became more frequent and helped change public opinion. One of the deadliest heat waves in
human history happened during the 2000s, mostly in Europe, with the 2003 European heat wave  killing 37,451 people
over the summer months.[249] In February 2009, a series of highly destructive bushfires  started in Victoria, Australia,
lasting into the next month. While the fires are believed to have been caused by arson, they were widely reported as
having been fueled by an excessive heatwave  that was due in part to climate change. It has also been alleged that climate
change was a cause of increased storms intensity , notably in the case of Hurricane Katrina .
Climate change became a major issue for governments, populations and scientists. Debates on global warming  and its
causes made significant progress, as climate change denials  were refuted by most scientific studies . Decisive reports
such as the Stern Review  and the 2007 IPCC Report  almost established a climate change consensus.[250] NGOs' actions
and the commitment of political perso nalities (such as former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) also urged to international reactions against climate change.
Documentary films An Inconvenient T ruth and Home  may have had a decisive impact.[251]Envir onment and climate change
International actionsUnder the auspices of The UN Conve ntion on Climate Change  the Kyoto Protocol  (aimed at combating global warming) entered into force on February 16,
2005. As of November 2009, 187 states have signed and ratified  the protocol.[252] In addition The UN Convention on Climate Change  helped coordinate the
efforts of the international community to fight potentially disastrous effects of human activity on the planet and launched negotiations to set an ambitious
program of carbon emission reduction that began in 2007 with the Bali Road  Map. How ever, the representatives of the then 192 member countries of the
United Nations gathered in December 2009 for the Copenhagen Confer ence failed to reach a binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions because of
divisions between regional areas.
However , as environmental technologies  were to make up a potential market, some countries made large investments in renewable energies, energy
conservation  and sustainable transport . Many government s launched national plans to promote sustainable energy. In 2003, the European Union members
created an emission trading scheme , and in 2007 they assembled a climate and energy package  to reduce further their carbon emission and improve their
energy-ef ficiency . In 2009, the United  States Obama administration set up the Green New Deal , a plan to create millions of jobs in sectors related to
environmentalism .
The Household Waste Recycling Act 2003  requires local autho rities in England  to provid e every household with a separate collection of at least two types of

The Millennium Bridge, London  officially known as the London Millennium Footbridge, is a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians crossing
the River Thames  in London, England , linking Bankside with the city . Londoners nicknamed the bridge the "W obbly Bridge" after participants
in a charity walk on behalf of Save the Children to open the bridge felt an unexpected, and, for some, uncomfortable, swaying motion on the
first two days after the bridge opened. The bridge was closed later that day , and after two days of limited access the bridge was closed for
almost two years while modifications were made to eliminate the wobble entirely . It was reopened in 2002.
30 St Mary Axe (informally also known as "the Gherkin" and previously the Swiss Re Building) is a skyscraper in London's financial district,
the City of London, completed in December 2003 and opened at the end of May 2004. The building has become an iconic symbol of London

Wembley Stadium  is a football stadium located in Wembley Park , in the Borough of Brent, London, England . It opened in 2007 and was built
on the site of the previous 1923 W embley Stadium. The earlier W embley stadium, originally called the Empire Stadium, was often referred to
as "The Twin Towers" and was one of the world's most famous football stadia until its demolition in 2003.
A major redevelopment of London's Trafalgar Square  led by WS Atkins  with Foster and Partners  as sub-consultants was completed in 2003.
The work involved closing the main eastbound road along the north side, diverting the traf fic around the other three sides of the square,
demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps leading up to a pedestrianised terrace in front
of the National Gallery . The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets, and a small café. Previously , access between
the square and the Gallery was by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners of the square.[254]
Taipei 101  became the tallest building in the world  ever built after it of ficially opened on December 31, 2004, a record it held until the opening

Lucian Freud  was a German-born British painter . Known chiefly for his thickly impastoed portrait and figure paintings, he was widely
considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time.[255]
During a period from May 2000 to December 2001, Freud painted Queen Elizabeth II . There was criticism of this portrayal of the Queen in
some sections of the British media. The highest selling tabloid newspaper , The Sun , was particularly condemnatory , describing the
portrait as "a travesty".[256]
The Hockney–Falco thesis  is a controversial theory of art history , advanced by artist David Hockney  and physicist Charles M. Falco ,
suggesting that advances in realism  and accuracy in the history of W estern art since the Renaissance  were primarily the result of optical aids
such as the camera obscura , camera lucida , and curved mirrors , rather than solely due to the development of artistic  technique and skill. In a
2001 book, Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost T echniques of the Old Masters , Hockney analyzed the work of the Old Masters  and
argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by "eyeballing it". Since then, Hockney and Falco have
produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods.
Rolf Harris  is an Australian entertainer . He is a musician, a singer-songwriter , a composer , a painter , and a television personality .
In 2005 he painted an of ficial portrait of Queen Elizabeth II , which was the subject of a special episode of Rolf on Art.
Harris's portrait of The Queen was voted by readers of the Radio T imes  the third favourite portrait of her . The royal portrait was exhibited
at Buckingham Palace , the Palace of Holyroodhouse  in Edinburgh , and was exhibited on a tour of public galleries in the UK.
In April–June 2003, the English visual artists often known as The Chapman Brothers , held a solo show at Modern Art Oxford  entitled The
Rape of Creativity  in which "the enfants terribles  of Britart, bought a mint collection of Goya's most celebrated prints – and set about
systematically defacing them".[257] The Francisco Goya  prints referred to his Disasters of W ar set of 80 etchings.[257] The duo named their
newly defaced works Insult to Injury .[257] BBC described more of the exhibition's art: "Drawings of mutant Ronald McDonalds, a bronze
sculpture of a painting showing a sad-faced Hitler in clown make-up and a major installation featuring a knackered old caravan and fake dog
turds."[258] The Daily T elegraph  commented that the Chapman brothers had "managed to raise the hackles of art historians by violating
something much more sacred to the art world than the human body – another work of art"[259]
As a protest against this piece, Aaron Barschak  (who later gate-crashed Prince William 's 21st birthday party dressed as Osama bin
Laden  in a frock) threw a pot of red paint over Jake Chapman during a talk he was giving in May 2003.
On May 5, 2004, a 1905 painting titled Garçon à la Pipe  (English: Boy with a Pipe) by Pablo Picasso  was sold for US$104,168,000 at
Sotheby's  auction  in New York City . At the time, it broke the record for the amount paid for an auctioned painting  (when inflation is ignored).
The amount, US$104 million, includes the auction price of US$93 million plus the auction house's commission of about US$11 million. ManyCultur e

Fine artsart critics have stated that the painting's high sale price has much more to do with the artist's name than with the merit or historical
importance of the painting. The W ashington Post 's article[260][261] on the sale contained the following characterisation of the reaction:
Picasso expert Pepe Karmel, reached in New York the morning after the sale, was waxing wroth about the whole affair. "I'm
stunned," he said, "that a pleasant, minor painting could command a price appropriate to a real masterwork by Picasso. This just
shows how much the marketplace is divorced from the true values of art."
On May 24, 2004, more than 100 artworks from the famous collection of art collector and sponsor of the Young British Artists  (YBAs) Charles
Saatchi 's were destroyed in a warehouse fire on an industrial estate in Leyton , east London . Modern art classics such as Tracey Emin 's tent
and works by Damien Hirst , Sarah Lucas  and Gary Hume  were lost.
Works by Patrick Caulfield , Craigie Horsfield  and 20 pieces by Martin Maloney  were also destroyed. They represent some of the cream of
the so-named " Britart " movement of celebrated modern artists.[262]
In 2004, during Channel 5 (UK) 's 'Big Art Challenge' television program, despite declaring: "I hold video and photography in profound
contempt." English art critic Brian Sewell , noted for artistic conservatism and having been described as "Britain's most famous and
controversial art critic",[263] went on to at least 3 times hail video artist (and ultimately the competition's winner) Chris Boyd (aged 21) a
"genius".[264][265]
In June 2007, the English artist, entrepreneur and art collector Damien Hirst  gained the European record for the most expensive work of art
by a living artist, when his Lullaby Spring , (a 3-metre-wide steel cabinet with 6,136 pills) sold for 19.2 million dollars.
In September 2008, Damien Hirst  took an unprecedented move for a living artist by selling a complete show , Beautiful Inside My Head
Forever , at Sotheby's  by auction and by-passing his long-standing galleries. The auction exceeded all predictions, raising £111 million
($198 million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction.
December 9, 2009 – when the most expensive drawing by an Old Master  ever , was sold in an auction. Titled 'Head of a Muse' by Raphael ;

Live-action films
The usage of computer -generated imagery  became more widespread in films during the 2000s. Documentary and
mockumentary  films, such as March of the Penguins , Borat , and Super Size Me, were popular in the 2000s. 2004's
Fahr enheit 9/11 by Michael Moore  is the highest-grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular ,
and conversion to digital cinema  started. Critically acclaimed movies released in the decade including highlights
such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and Lost in T ranslation .
December 2009's Avatar , an American science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron , made
extensive use of cutting edge motion capture  filming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing, 3D
viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats). It was also released in "4D" in
select South Korean theaters.[270]
3D films  became more and more successful throughout the 2000s, culminating in the unprecedented success of 3D
presentations of Avatar .
Roger Ebert , described by Forbes  as "the most powerful pundit  in America",[271] was skeptical of the resurgence of 3D ef fects in film , which
he found unrealistic and distracting.[272]
In August 2004, American horror author Stephen King , in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from
critics. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider -Man 2  as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve:
"Formerly reliable critics who seem to have gone remarkably soft – not to say softhearted and sometimes softheaded – in their old age."[273]FilmIn July 2005, it was reported that the Scottish actor and producer Sir Sean Connery  had decided to retire, due to disillusionment with the "idiots now in
Hollywood"' Telling  The New Zealand Herald : "I'm fed up with the idiots... the ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the
people who greenlight the movies."[274]
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , a 2003 epic fantas y-drama film directed by Peter Jackson based on the secon d and third volumes of J. R. R.
Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards  and won all the categories for which it was nominated.[275] The film is tied for
largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur  (1959) and Titanic  (1997).
The Passion of the Christ , a 2004 American film directed by Mel Gibson  and starri ng Jim Caviezel  as Jesus Christ, was highly controv ersial[276] and received
mixed reviews; however , it was a major commercial hit, grossing in excess of $600 million worldwide during its theatrical release.[277]
The superhero film genre experienced renewed and intense interest throughout the 2000s. With high ticket and DVD sales, several new superhero films were
released every year. DC Comics  and Marvel Comics  feature full-length superhero films including Superman , Batman , Spider -Man  and X-Men . Some media
commentators attributed the increased popularity of such franchises to the social and political climate in Western society since the September 11th attacks ,[278]
although others ar gued advances in special ef fects technology played a more significant role.[279]
Animated films
The animated feature film market changed radically . Computer animated films  became hugely popular following the release of Toy Story in the mid-1990s.
After failures such as The Road to El Dorado , The Wild Thornberrys Movie , Rugrats Go Wild, Osmosis Jones, Hey Arnold!: The Movie and Looney Tunes:
Back in Action , studios have stoppe d their production of traditional 2D animated films, and gradually changed their focus into CGI animation in the late 2000s.
Traditional 2D animated films that did well in the first half of the decade include  Rugrats in Paris: The Movie , Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarr on, The SpongeBob
Squar ePants Movie , and Lilo & Stitch  as well as anime  films such as Studio Ghibli 's Spirited Away, The Cat Returns , Howl's Moving Castle , and Ponyo .
Disney  would begin making 3D animated films such as Dinosaur , Chicken Little , Meet the Robinsons , and Bolt as well as continui ng to make traditional
animated films from  the past decades such as The Emper or's New Groove , Atlantis: The Lost Empir e, Treasur e Planet , Brother Bear, Home on the Range , and
The Princess and the Fr og. All of these films would underperform at the box of fice and receive adequate reviews although they would become cult classics .
Meanwhile, computer -animated films saw the rise of Pixar  throughou t the 2000s with their critically and commercially films like Monsters, Inc., Finding
Nemo , The Incr edibles , Cars , Ratatouille , WALL-E , and Up.
DreamW orks also began to take its rise albeit to a lesser extent as the 2003 movie Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas became the last traditional animated
DreamW orks film. These films include Shrek, Shrek 2, Madagascar , Over the Hedge , Flushed Away, Shrek the Third, Bee Movi e, Kung Fu Panda ,
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa , and Monsters vs. Aliens .
20th Century Fox Animation 's works in that decade include the Ice Age series, Robots  and Horton Hears a Who! whic h were all made by its Blue Sky Studios
subsidiary , and Titan A.E., Waking Life , The Simpsons Movie , and Fantastic Mr . Fox .
In 2006, Warner Bros.  and Village Roadshow Pictures  animated film Happy Feet .
Columbia Pictures  and Sony Pictures Animation  films such as Open Season , Surf's Up , and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs .
In 2009, computer -animated science fiction comedy film Planet 51 .
Stop motion  animated films in that decade which mostly use live-action or computer animation methods included Chicken Run, Team America: World Police ,
Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit , Corpse Bride , Flushed Away, Coraline , and Mary and Max. Independent  animated works in that decade
included The T riplets of Belleville , Laura's Star , A Scanner Darkly , Renaissance , Persepolis , Sita Sings the Blues , The Secr et of Kells  and A Town Called Panic .

In the 2000s, the Internet allowed consumers unprecedented access to music. The Internet also allowed
more artists to distribute music relativ ely inexpensively and independently without the previously
necessary financial support of a record label. Music sales began to decline following the year 2000, a
state of affairs gene rally attributed to unlicensed uploading and downloading of sound files to the
Internet, a practice which became more widely prevalent during this time. Business relationships called
360 deals —an arrangement in which a company  provides support for an artist, and, in exchange, the
artist pays the company a percentage of revenue earned not only from sales of recorded music, but also
live performances and publishing—became a popular response by record labels to the loss of music
sales attributed to online copyright infringement.[326][327]
In the 2000s, hip hop reached a commerc ial peak and heavi ly influenced various aspects of popular
culture, dominating the musical landsca pe of the decade.[328][329] The best-selling musical artist of the

In alternative rock, the garage rock revival  and post-punk revival  entered the mainst ream, with bands such as The Strokes , Interpol , The Killers , Arctic

Soundsystem , The Shins , Wilco, Bright Eyes , Spoon , The Decemberists , Broken Social Scene , Grizzly Bear , Fleet Foxes  and many more.

Boy and Panic! at the Disco .[332][333][334][335]
In the early and mid 2000s, disco-inspired dance genres became popular; many  french house and funky house songs broke into the charts.[336] Popu lar tracks
such as Daft Punk 's "One More Time" Fonzerelli 's "Moonlight Party ", Kylie Minogue 's "Spinning Around ", Jamiroquai 's "Little L", Michael Gray 's "The
Weekend " and Freemasons  "Love on My Mind ".

musicians of all time – died of a drug overd ose, creating the largest global public  mourning  since the death  of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.[341][342][343]
Other notable deaths of musical artists in the 2000s were Joey Ramone  and Chet Atkins  in 2001, Waylon Jennings  in 2002, Maurice Gibb  and Elliott Smith  in
2003, Rick James  and Ol' Dirty Bastard  in 2004, J Dilla  in 2006, Ike Turner  and Dan Fogelber g in 2007, and Les Paul  in 2009.
In 2002, Robbie Williams  signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI.[344] So far it is the biggest music deal in British history .
The 2000s gave rise to a new trend in music production with the growing use of auto-tune . The effect was first popularized in the early 2000s by Eiffel 65 with
their 1998  hit song "Blue (Da Ba Dee) ", which came to global prominence in 2000. It was also used in certain tracks off critically acclaimed 2001 albums from
Daft Punk  (with Discovery ) and Radiohead  (with Amnesiac ).[327] By 2008, auto-tune was part of the music mainstream with artists such as Lil Wayne , T-Pain
and Kanye West utilizing it in their hit albums Tha Carter III, Three Ringz  and 808s & Heartbr eak respectively . Towards the end of the decade, electronic
dance music began to dominate western charts (as it would proceed to in the following decade), and in turn helped contribute to a diminishing amount of rock
music in the mainstream.[345][346] Hip hop music  also saw a decline in the mainstream in the late 2000s because of electronic music's rising popularity .[347]
According to The Guardian, music styles during  the 2000s changed very little from how they were in the latter half of the 1990s.[348] The 2000s had a profound
impact on the condition of music distribution . Recent advents in digital technology have fundamentally altered industry and marketing practices as well as
players in unusual rapidity .[349][350][351] According to Nielse n Soundscan, by 2009 CDs accounted for 79 percent of album sales, with 20 percent coming from
digital, representing both a 10 percent drop and gain for both formats in 2 years.[352]
Grime  is a style of music that emer ged from Bow, East Lond on, England  in the early 2000s, primarily as a devel opment of UK garage, drum & bass, hip hop
and dancehall. Pioneers of the style include English rappers Dizzee Rascal , Wiley, Roll Deep  and Skepta .
Michael Jackson's final album, Invincible , released on October 30, 2001, and costing $30m to record, was the most expensive record ever made.[353]
The end of the 2000s decade also saw the dramatic rise of new pop stars such as Rihanna , Taylor Swift , Justin Bieber , Katy Perry , Nicki Minaj  and Lady Gaga ,
all of whom would go on to become some of the best-selling musicians in history .[354]Live 8 concert in Rome, Italy, 2005The general socio-political fallout of Iraq War also exten ded to popular music. In July 2002, the release of English musician Geor ge Michael 's song "Shoot the
Dog" proved to be controversial. It was critical of Geor ge W. Bush  and Tony Blair  in the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The video showed  a cartoon
version of Michael astride a nuclear missile in the Middle East and Tony and Cherie Blair  in bed with President Bush. The Dixie Chicks  are an American
country music band.  During a London  concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said, "we don't want this war, this violence, and
we're ashamed that the President of the United States [Geor ge W. Bush ] is from Texas".[355] The posit ive reactio n to this statement from the British audience
contrasted with the boycotts  that ensued in the U.S., where "the band was assaulted by talk-show conservatives ",[356] while their albums were discarded in
public protest.[356] The original music  video for the title song  from American pop singer Madonna 's American Life album was banned  as music television
stations thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery , would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. She also made her
widely considered "comeback" album with her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor  whic h topped the charts worldwide in a record 40 countries.
As of 2016 the album has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide. Madonna  also made  history by completing her Sticky & Sweet Tour whic h became the
highest-grossing tour by a female artist and the tenth highest-grossing tour by an artist  during 2008–2009.[357]
Live 8 was a string of benefit concerts  that took place on July 2, 2005, in the G8 states and in South Africa. They were
timed to precede the G8 conference and summit  held at the Gleneagles Hotel  in Auchterarder , Scotland from July 6 to 8,
2005; they also coincided with the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. Run in support of the aims of the UK's Make Poverty
History  campaign and the Global Call for Action Against Poverty , ten simultaneous concerts were held on July 2 and
one on July 6. On July 7, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to
US$50 billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa. More than 1,000 musicians performed at the
concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.[358]
In November 2006, the Rolling Stones ' 'A Bigger Bang ' tour was declared the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning $437 million.
In December 2009, a campaign was launched on Facebook  by Jon and Tracy Mort er, from  South Woodham Ferrers, which generated publicity in the UK and
took the 1992 Rage Against the Machine  track "Killing in the Name " to the Christmas Number One slot in the UK Singles Chart , which had been occupied the
four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the TV show The X Factor . Rage's Zack de la Rocha  spoke to BBC One  upon hearing the news, stating that:
"...W e want to thank everyone that participated in this incredible, organic, grass-roots campaign. It says more about the spontaneous action taken by young
people throughout the UK to topple this very sterile pop monopoly ."
During the late 2000 s, a new wave of chiptune  culture took place. This new culture has much more emphasis on live performances and record releases than the
demoscene and tracker culture, of which the new artists are often only distantly aware.[359] Much of 2000s hip hop was character ized as the "bling era",
following the success of B.G. 's 1999 single Bling Bling , referring to forms of opulence and the material commodities that were popula r from the early-to-mid
part of the decade in hip-hop culture.[360][361][362] However , by the end of the decade, an antecedent emotional rap subgenre gained prominence, with musical
projects like Kanye West's fourth studio album 808s & Heartbr eak (2008), Kid Cudi 's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009), and Drake 's
career catalyzing mixtape So Far Gone  (2009) garnering significant popularity and ushering in a new era of hip hop.[363]
The original five members of the English new wave  band Duran Duran  reunited in the early 2000s.
On February 23, 2003, Simon and Garfunkel  reunited to perform  in public for the first time in a decade, singing "The Sound of Silence" as the opening act of
the Grammy Awards .[364]
On May 9, 2006, British five-piece vocal pop Take That returned to the recorded music scene after more than ten years of absence, signing with Polydor
Records . The band's comeback album, Beautiful W orld, entered the UK album chart at no. 1.[365]
On December 10, 2007, English rock band Led Zeppelin  reunited for the one-of f Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at The O2 Arena in Londo n. Accord ing to

The BBC's foreign correspondent John Simpson  on Rupert Murdoch  (March 15, 2010):JournalismI do think that he and the newspapers he's run have introduced an uglier side, an abusive side, into journalism and life in general in
this country .
He says this Murdochisation of national discourse, which was at its height in the UK with The Sun  in the 1980s, has now migrated to the US.
"Murdoch encouraged an ugly tone, which he has now imported into the US and which we see every day on Fox News , with all its
concomitant ef fects on American public life – that fierce hostility between right and left that never used to be there, not to anything remotely
like the same extent."[387]

On Septe mber 11, [2001] watching TV replays of the buildings exploding over and over again in New York and Washington, I
couldn't help thinking about all the times media coverage has protected us from similar horrors elsewhere. During the Gulf War, for
instance, we didn't see real building s exploding or people fleeing, we saw a sterile Space Invader battlefield, a bomb's-eye view of
concrete targets – there and then none. Who was in those abstract polygons? W e never found out.[388]

conclude here and take your questions.

technically in 1998 with the release of Sega's Dreamcast , although some consider the true start in 2000 with the release of Sony's PlayS tation 2. The 6th gen
remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with
the release of Micro soft's Xbox 360, however , most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including
the Xbox even though the 360 was alrea dy released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true
start of the 7th gen. It reached 7th Gener ation  in the form of consoles  like the Wii, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by the mid-2000s. The number -one-sellingSeries returns

launched in Japan  in 2004  and by 2005  was availa ble globa lly. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold over 154.02
million units, thus making it the best selling handheld of all time and the second best selling video game console  of all
time behind the PlayStation 2 .[425][426]
Neo Geo is a famil y of video game hardware developed by SNK . The brand originated in 1990 with the release of an
arcade system, the Neo Geo MVS  and its home console counterpart, the Neo Geo AES . The Neo Geo brand was
officially discontinued in 2004.
MMORPGs , originating in the mid-to-late 1990s, become a popular PC trend and virtual online worlds become a reality
as games such as RuneScape  (2001), Final Fantasy XI (2002), Eve Online  (2003), Tony Hawk's Under ground  (2003),
World of Warcraft  (2004), and EverQuest II (2004), The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar  (2007) and
Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning  (2008) are released. These worlds come complete with their own economies and
social organization as directed by the players as a whole. The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular
for many years. World of Warcraft , premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still
being developed into the 2010s.
Arcade video games  had declin ed in popularity so much by the late 1990s, that revenues in the United States dropped to
$1.33 billion in 1999,[427] and reach ed a low of $866 million in 2004.[428] Furth ermore, by the early 2000s, netwo rked
gaming via computers and then consoles across the Internet had also appeared,[429] replacing the venue of head-to-head
competition and social atmosphere once provided solely by arcades.[430]
Cross-platform  Game engines originatin g in the very late-1990s, became extremely popular in the 2000s , as they
allowed developmen t for indie games  for digital distribution . Noteworthy software include GameMaker  and Unity . Well-
known indie games made in that decade include I Wanna Be the Guy, Spelunky , Braid , Clean Asia!, Castle Crashers ,

In the late 2000s, motion controlled  video games grew in popularity , from  the PlayStation 2's EyeT oy to Ninten do's
successful Wii console. During the decade 3D video games become the staple of the video -game industry , with 2D
games nearly fading from the market. Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the
decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusi vely for fully 3D games to satisfy the
increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community , which often
produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as Minecraft  and Shadow Complex . These games, which are not developed by the
industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as Microsoft 's Xbox Live or Apple' s App Store  and usual ly cost
much less than more major releases.

games during the mid-late 2000s. Gears of War 1 was released in 2006 and was the first installment to the franchise, it
was universally critically acclaimed and went on to sell over 5 million copies. The second installment to the franchise

and Irelan d, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States. As neither Sony , Microsoft  or Nintendo  allow

game  sales of $3.2 billion that same year.[435] In particular , arcade video games are a thriving industry in China , where
arcades are widespread across the country .[436] The US market has also experienced a slight resur gence, with the number

other aspects of its human rights record. In a 2008 Time article entitled "Why Nobody's Boycotting Beijing", Vivienne Walt wrote: 'Leaders in power are more

saving the lives of the Israeli citizens who continue to be targeted
by the terrorist campaign that began in 2000. The fact that over 800

bombings and other terror attacks clearly justifies the attempt to
place a physical barrier in the path of terrorists.... terrorism has
been defined throughout the international community as a crime

attacks in 2006 than in any year since the Palestinian uprising
began in 2000. Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign
visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height
of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in
Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year , only two Palestinian suicide
bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11
people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months
without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period
without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military
spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been
Israel's controversial separation barrier , a still-growing 250-mile
(400 km) network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other
obstacles that cuts through parts of the W est Bank. 'The security
fence was put up to stop terror , and that's what it's doing,' said
Capt. Noa Meir , a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...]
Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it has been
effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route
should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian
territories known as the Green Line. [...] IDF spokeswoman Meir
said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning
attacks from the W est Bank also deserved credit for the drop in
Israeli fatalities. "
