to evacuations of South Vietnamese that same year; the
1973 oil crisis causes a financial crisis throughout the
developed world; both the leaders of Israel and Egypt

independence movements in East Pakistan, killing
300,000 to 3,000,000 people; this consequently leads to
the Bangladesh Liberation War; the 1970 Bhola
cyclone kills an estimated 500,000 people in the
densely populated Ganges Delta region of East
Pakistan in November 1970, and became the deadliest
natural disaster in 40 years; the Iranian Revolution of
1979 ousts Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who is later

1970s
The 1970s  (pronounced "nineteen-seventies"; commonly
shortened to the "Seventies " or the "'70s") was the decade
that began on Januar y 1, 1970, and ended on December 31,
1979.
In the 21st century , historians have increasingly portrayed
the 1970s as a "pivo t of change" in world history , focusing
especially on the economic upheavals[1] that followed the
end of the postwar economic boom .[2] On a global scale, it
was characterized by frequent coups, domestic conflicts
and civil wars, and various political upheavals and armed
conflicts which arose from or were related to
decolonization , and the global struggle between NATO, the
Warsaw Pact, and the Non-Aligned Move ment . Many
regions had periods of high-intensity  conflict, notably
Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America , and
Africa .
In the Western world, social progressive  values that began
in the 1960s , such as increasing political awareness and
economic liberty of women , continued to grow . In the
United Kingdom, the 1979 election  resulted in the victory
of its Conservative  leader Margaret Thatcher , the first
female British Prime Minister . Industrialized countries
experienced an economic recession  due to an oil crisis
caused by oil embar goes by the Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries . The crisis saw the first
instance of stagflation  which began a political and
economic trend  of the replacement of Keynesian  econ omic
theory with neoliberal  economic theory , with the first
neoliberal government coming to power with the 1973
Chilean coup d'état .
The 1970s was also an era of great technological and
scientific advances; since the appearance of the first
commercial microprocessor , the Intel 4004  in 1971, the
decade was characterised by a profound  transformation of
computing units – by then rudimentary , spacious machines
– into the realm of portability and home accessibility . There
were also great advances in fields such as physics, which
saw the consolidation of quantum field theory  at the end of
the decade, mainly thanks to the confirmation of the
existence of quarks  and the detection of the first gauge bosons  in addition to the photon , the Z boson  and the gluon ,
part of what was christened in 1975 as the Standard Model .In Asia, the People's Republic of China 's international relations changed significantly following its recognition by
the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong  and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors.
Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC  embar go, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period,
overtaking the economy of West Germany to become the second-lar gest in the world.[3] The United States withdrew
its military forces from the Vietnam War. In 1979, the Sovie t Union invaded Afghanistan, which led to the Soviet–
Afghan War.
The 1970s  saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, starting
the Yom Kippur War, but in the late 1970s, the situation was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the
Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty . Political  tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution  in 1979, which
overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty  and established an Islamic republic  under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini .
Africa saw further decolonization  in the decade, with Angola  and Mozambique  gaining their independence in 1975
from the Portuguese Empire  after the Carnation Revolutio n in Portuga l. Further more, Spain  withdrew its claim over
Spanish Sahara  in 1976, marking the formal end of the Spanish Empire . The continent was, however , plagued by
endemic military coups, with the long-r eigning Emperor of Ethiopia  Haile Selassie being removed, civil wars and
famine.
The economies of much of the developing world  continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of
the Green Revolution . However , their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis, although it boomed afterwards.
The 1970s  saw the world population increase from 3.7 to 4.4 billion, with appro ximately 1.23 billion births and 475
million deaths occurring during the decade.

The Israelis were taken by surprise and suf fered heavy
losses before they rallied. In the end, they managed to
repel the Egyptians (and a simultaneous attack by
Syria in the Golan Heights) and crossed the Suez
Canal into Egypt proper . In 1978, Egypt signed a
peace treaty with Israel at Camp David  in the United
States, ending outstanding disputes between the two
countries. Sadat's actions would lead to his
assassination in 1981 .
Turkish invasion of Cyprus  (1974)

The most notable International conflicts of the decade include:International conflicts1979 Iranian RevolutionMajor conflict between capitalist and communist forces in multiple
countries, while attempts are made by the Soviet Union and the United
States to lessen the chance for conflict, such as both countries endorsing
nuclear nonproliferation.
In June 1976, peaceful student protests in the Soweto  township of South
Africa by black students against the use of Afrikaans in schools led to the
Soweto uprising  which killed more than 176 people, overwhelmingly by
South Africa's Security Police .[4]
Rise of separatism in the province of Quebec  in Canada. In 1970, radical
Quebec nationalist  and Marxist  militants of the Front de libération du
Québec  (FLQ) kidnapped the Quebec labour minister Pierre Laporte  and
British Trade Commissioner James Cross  during the October Crisis ,
resulting in Laporte being killed, and the enactment of martial law  in
Canada under the War Measures Act, resulting in a campaign by the
Canadian government which arrests suspected FLQ supporters. The
election of the Parti Québécois  led by René Lévesque  in the province of
Quebec  in Canada, brings the first political party committed to Quebec
independence into power in Quebec. Lévesque's government pursues an agenda to secede Quebec
from Canada by democratic means and strengthen Francophone Québécois culture in the late 1970s,
such as the controversial Charter of the French Language  more commonly known in Quebec and
Canada as "Bill 101".
Martial law  was declared in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, by dictator  Ferdinand Marcos .
In Cambodia, the communist leader Pol Pot  led a revolution against the American-backed government
of Lon Nol . On April 17, 1975, Pot's forces captured Phnom Penh , the capital, two years after America
had halted the bombings of their positions. His communist government, the Khmer Rouge , forced
people out of the cities to clear jungles and establish a radical, Marxist agrarian society . Buddhist
priests and monks, along with anyone who spoke foreign languages, had any sort of education, or
even wore glasses were tortured or killed. As many as 3 million people may have died. V ietnam
invaded the country  at the start of 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a satellite
government . This provoked a brief, but furious border war with China  in February of that year .
The Iranian Revolution  of 1979 transformed Iran from an autocratic pro-W estern monarchy under
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi  to a theocratic  Islamist  government under the leadership of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini . Distrust between the revolutionaries and W estern powers led to the Iran hostage
crisis  on November 4, 1979, where 66 diplomats, mainly from the United States, were held captive for
444 days.
Growing internal tensions take place in Yugoslavia  beginning with the Croatian Spring  movement in
1971 which demands greater decentralization of power to the constituent republics of Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia's communist ruler Joseph Broz Tito subdues the Croatian Spring movement and arrests its
leaders, but does initiate major constitutional reform resulting in the 1974 Constitution  which
decentralized powers to the republics, gave them the of ficial right to separate from Yugoslavia, and
weakened the influence of Serbia (Y ugoslavia's largest and most populous constituent republic) in the
federation by granting significant powers to the Serbian autonomous provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina . In addition, the 1974 Constitution consolidated Tito's dictatorship by proclaiming him
president-for-life. The 1974 Constitution would become resented by Serbs and began a gradual
escalation of ethnic tensions.

in world history.1974 – (25 April) Carnation Revolution  in Portugal started as a military
coup organized by the Armed Forces Movement (Portuguese: Movimento
das Forças Armadas, MF A) composed of military of ficers who opposed
the Portuguese fascist regime, but the movement was soon coupled with
an unanticipated and popular campaign of civil support. It would
ultimately lead to the decolonization of all its colonies, but leave power
vacuums that led to civil war in newly independent Lusophone African
nations.
1975 – Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , President of Bangladesh , and almost his
entire family was assassinated  in the early hours of August 15, 1975,
when a group of Bangladesh Army  personnel went to his residence and

Palestinians belonging to the terrorist group Black September  organization kidnapped and murdered
eleven Israeli athletes.
Rise in the use of terrorism by militant organizations across the world. Groups in Europe like the Red
Brigades  and the Baader-Meinhof  Gang were responsible for a spate of bombings, kidnappings, and
murders. V iolence continued in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. Radical American groups
existed as well, such as the Weather Underground  and the Symbionese Liberation Army , but they
never achieved the size or strength of their European counterparts.
On September 6, 1970, the world witnessed the beginnings of modern rebellious fighting in what is
today called as Skyjack Sunday . Palestinian terrorists hijacked four airliners  and took over 300 people
on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up.

In Guyana, the Rev . Jim Jones  led several hundred people from
his People's Temple in California to create and maintain a Utopian
Marxist commune in the jungle named Jonestown . Amid
allegations of corruption, mental, sexual, and physical abuse by
Jones on his followers, and denying them the right to leave
Jonestown, a Congressional committee and journalists visited
Guyana to investigate in November 1978. The visitors (and
several of those trying to leave Jonestown with them) were
attacked and shot by Jones' guards at the airport while trying to
depart Guyana together . Congressman Leo Ryan  was among
those who were shot to death. The demented Jones then ordered
everyone in the commune to commit suicide. The people drank or were forced to drink, cyanide-laced
fruit punch (Flavor Aid). A total of over 900 dead were found (approximately 1/3 of which were
children), including Jones, who had shot himself. Multiple units of the United States military were
organized, mobilized, and sent to Guyana to recover over 900 deceased Jonestown residents. After
rejections from the Guyanese Government for the United States to bury the Jonestown dead in
Guyana, US military personnel were then tasked to prepare and transport the human remains from
Guyana for burial in the USA. The US General Accounting Of fice later detailed an approximate cost of
$4.4 million (in taxpayer dollars) for Jonestown's clean-up and recovery operation expenses.

Socialist and Communist parties were legalized. The current
Spanish Constitution was signed in 1978.
In 1972, Erich Honecker  was chosen to lead East Germany , a role
he would fill for the whole of the 1970s and 1980s. The mid-1970s
were a time of extreme recession for East Germany , and as a
result of the country's higher debts, consumer goods became
more and more scarce. If East Germans had enough money to procure a television set, a telephone,
or a Trabant  automobile, they were placed on waiting lists which caused them to wait as much as a
decade for the item in question.
The Troubles  in Northern Ireland continued, with an explosion of political violence erupting in the early
1970s. Notable attacks include the McGurk's Car bombing , the Bloody Sunday  massacre, and the

Anwar Sadat shake hands, Camp
David, 1978
Nixon and Zhou toast, 1972The Soviet Union under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev , having the largest armed forces and the
largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, pursued an agenda to lessen tensions with its rival
superpower , the United States, for most of the seventies. That policy , known as détente , abruptly
ended with the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan  at the end of 1979. While known as a "period of
stagnation" in Soviet historiography , the Seventies are largely considered as a sort of a golden age  of
the USSR in terms of stability and relative well-being. Nevertheless, hidden inflation continued to
increase for the second straight decade, and production consistently fell short of demand in
agriculture and consumer goods manufacturing. By the end of the 1970s, signs of social and
economic stagnation were becoming very pronounced.
Enver Hoxha 's rule in Albania was characterized in the 1970s by growing isolation, first from a very
public schism with the Soviet Union the decade before, and then by a split in friendly relations with
China in 1978. Albania normalized relations with Yugoslavia  in 1971, and attempted trade agreements
with other European nations, but was met with vocal disapproval by the United Kingdom and the
United States.

Karol W ojtyła, a Polish cardinal, was elected, becoming Pope John Paul II . He was the first non-Italian
pope since 1523.
Asia
On September 17, 1978, the Camp David Accords  were signed

sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.
Major changes in the People's Republic of China. US president
Richard Nixon  visited the country in 1972  following visits by Henry
Kissinger  in 1971, restoring relations between the two countries,
although formal diplomatic ties were not established until 1979. In
1976, Mao Zedong  and Zhou Enlai  both died, leading to the end of
the Cultural Revolution  and the beginning of a new era. After the
brief rule of Mao's chosen successor Hua Guofeng , Deng
Xiaoping  emerged as China's paramount leader , and began to
shift the country towards market economics and away from
ideologically driven policies. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping visited the
US.
In 1971, the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek , then- President of
the Republic of China  (Taiwan), were expelled  from the United
Nations and replaced by the People's Republic of China. Chiang
Kai-shek died in 1975, and in 1978 his son Chiang Ching-kuo
became president, beginning a shift towards democratization in
Taiwan.
In Iraq, Saddam Hussein  began to rise to power by helping to
modernize the country . One major initiative was removing the
Western monopoly on oil, which later during the high prices of
1973 oil crisis  would help Hussein's ambitious plans. On July 16, 1979, he assumed the presidency
cementing his rise to power . His presidency led to the breaking of f of a Syrian-Iraqi unification, which
had been sought under his predecessor Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr  and would lead to the Iran–Iraq W ar
starting in the 1980s.

Superpower tensions  had cooled by the 1970s, with the bellicose US–Soviet confrontations of the 1950s–60s giving
way to the policy of détente , which promoted the idea that the world's problems could be resolved at the negotiating
table. Détente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the worldNon-natural disasters

Sauddangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following
the failure  of the Vietnam War. As part of détente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China,
partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.
The US–Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as
the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries.  American and Soviet intelligence
agencies gave fundin g, training, and material support to insur gent groups, governments, and armies across the globe,
each seeki ng to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism
went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist
groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive
dictatorship. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundam entalism, as the Shi'a theocracy of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and
godless communism.
People were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society
in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical social structure .
The Green Revolution  of the late 1960s brought about self-suf ficiency in food in many developing economies. At
the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently
saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social communities amid increasing information blockade
across social class.
Another common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women
in industrialized societies. More women could enter the workforce. However , the gender role of men remained as
that of a breadwinner . The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women
entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The Iranian revolution  also affected global attitudes toward and
among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.
The global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global zeitgeist  revealed the
interdependence of economies since World War II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and
the Soviet Union.

The 1970s were perhaps the worst decade of most industrialized countries' economic performance since the Great
Depression .[18] Although there was no severe economic depression  as witnes sed in the 1930s, economic growth
rates were considerably lower than previous decades. As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the
prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979  adde d to the existing ailments
and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries
began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus (as of 2009 ) in 1975.  In contra st,
Japan and West Germany experienced  economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading
manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-lar gest economy .[3] Japan
would rank as the world's second-lar gest economy until 1994 when the European Economic  Area  (18 coun tries
under a single market) came into ef fect.
In the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approx imately 2.5%. From 1970 to 1979,
however , the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.[19] This period is also known
for "stagflation ", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit
interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime  rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the
highest in history .[18] A rising cost of housing was reflected in the average price of a new home in the U.S. The
average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when
U.S. Presi dent Jimmy Carter was running for re-election  against Ronald Reagan , the misery index (the sum of the
unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.[20] The economic problems of the
1970s would result in a sluggish cynicis m replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of
government and technology . Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate,
as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election. There was also the 1973–74
stock market crash .EconomyLine at a gas station in Maryland,
June 15, 1979.Great Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved
unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost
paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the Winter of Discontent , Margaret Thatcher was elected prime
minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.
In Eastern Europe, Soviet-style comma nd economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were
persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particu larly Soviet, exports, but a growing
inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the COMECON  block, and a
growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.
On the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially
by the Four Asian  Tigers  (Hong Kong, South  Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan),
resulted in rapid economic transform ation and industrialization. Their
abundance of cheap labor , combined with educational and other policy
reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s
and beyond.
Economically , the 1970s were marked by the energy crisis  whic h peaked in
1973 and 1979 (see 1973 oil crisis  and 1979 oil crisis ). After the first oil
shock in 1973, gasoline was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil;
the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced
car-free days and weekends. In the Unite d States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only
allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbere d days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on
even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not
sustainable  without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progr ess that had existed since
the 19th century . As a result, ecological awareness  rose substantially , which had a major ef fect on the economy .
The 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the
integrated circuit , and the laser. Stephen Hawking  developed his theor ies of black holes  and the boundary-c ondition
of the universe at this period with his theory called Hawking radiation . The biological sciences greatly advanced,
with molecular biology , bacteriology , virology , and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade.
Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and Stephen Jay Gould 's theory of punctuated
equilibrium  revolutionized evolutionary thought.
As the 1960s ended,  the United States had made two successful crewed lunar landings . Many Americans lost interest
afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President John F. Kennedy 's goal of landing on the Moon
by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions
of dollars spent on the space program  should be put to other uses. The Moon  landings continued through 1972, but
the near loss of the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 served to further anti-NASA  feelings. Plans for missions up to
Apollo 20 were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and Saturn  hardware was used for the Skylab  space station
program in 1973–1974, and for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project  (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of
the ambitious projects NASA  had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it
would devote most of the decade to the development of the Space Shuttle . ASTP was the last crewed AmericanOil crisis

had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to
save it.
Meanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By
then, however , they had already begun Salyut , the world 's first space station  program, which began in 1971. This
would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the Soyuz 11 crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the
Soyuz 18a crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missio ns as long as six months
being conducted by the end of the decade.
In terms of uncrewed missions, a variety of lunar and planetary probes  were  launched by the US and Soviet
programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet Lunokhod  program, a series of robotic
lunar missions which included the first uncrewed sample return  from  another world, and the American Voyagers ,
which took advantage of a rare alignm ent of the outer planets to visit all of them except Pluto  by the end of the
1980s.
China entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first satellite , but technological backwardness and
limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a
satellite for the first time in 1972. The European Space Agency  was founded during the decade as well.

1973 Volvo P1800 sportwagon.The 1970s  was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety
concerns, and emissions controls. The 1973 oil crisis  caused a move towards
smaller , fuel-ef ficien t vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars,
but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars
became a significan t factor for the first time, and several domestic-built
subcompact models  entered the market. American-made cars such as the
"quirky" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean  shaped AMC Pacer, and Pontiac
Firebird 's powerful Trans Am "sum up" the decade.[22] Muscle cars and
convertible  models faded from favor during the early-1970s. It was believed
that the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado  would be the last American-built
convertible; ending  the open body style that once dominated the auto
industry .[23]
Cars in the U.S. from the early 1970s are noted more for their power than
their styling, but they even lost their power by Malaise era of the late-
1970s.[24][25] Styling on America n cars became progressively more boxy and
rectilinear during the 1970s,[26] with coupes  being the most popular body
style. Wood paneling and shag carpets dominated the interiors. Many
automobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brands
and autom akers, as well as featuring "luxury" enhancements such as vinyl
roofs  and opera windows .[24] Only a few had "real personalities" such as the
AMC Gremlin, which was America's first modern subcompact , and the AMC
Pacer .[24] "These two cars embody a sense of artful desperation that made
them stand out from  the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of
the seventies."[24]
Automobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors  managed to
downsize  its full-size models to more manageab le dimensions. Ford  followed suit two years later, with Chrysler
offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by
various factors. By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy , and under its new president Lee Iacocca  (who had been
fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. American Motors  beat out the U.S. Big Three  to
subcompact sized model (the Gremlin ) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a
partnership with the French automaker Renault  in 1979.
European car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the
need for performance with high fuel efficiency —designs such as the
Volkswagen Golf and Passa t, BMW  3, 5, and 7 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-
Class  appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford
Germany , also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company . The
designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro  became dominant, along with those of
Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical
failure of the British car industry—a combination of militant strikes and poor
quality control effectively halted development at British Leyland , owner of
all other British car companies during the 1970s.
The Japanese automobile industry  flourished  during the 1970s, compared  to other major auto markets. Japanese
vehicles became internationally renown ed for their affordability , reliability , and fuel-ef ficiency , which was very
important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized
robotic manufacturing techniques and lean manufacturing , contributing to high-ef ficiency and low production costs.

The role of women in society was profo undly
altered with growing feminism  across the world and
with the presence and rise of a significa nt number of
women as heads of state outside monarchies and
heads of government in a number of countries across
the world during the 1970s, many being the first
women to hold such positions. Non-monarch women

The opposition to the War in Vietnam  that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s. One of the
best-known anti-war demonstrations was the Kent State shootings . In 1970, university students were protesting the
war and the draft. Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace.
However , by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting.
Four students were killed and nine were injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and
became a staple of anti-V ietnam demonstrations.Society

A Women's Liberation march in
Washington, D.C., 1970The 1970s  started a mainstream affirmat ion of the environmental issues  early
activists from the 1960s, such as Rachel Carson  and Murray Bookchin , had
warned of. The Apollo 11 mission, which had occurred at the end of the
previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an
integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to
preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first Earth
Day, in which  over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten
thousand primary and secondary schools participated.
The 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing
social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasin gly accepted in the Western world.
The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor . Western Europe
was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United State s, as nudity in film and on TV had
been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countr ies during this time began allowing
women to go topless  in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and
Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in
the 1980s to 1990s.
The market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer
population, and the 1972 movie Behind the Green Door, an X-rated feature,  became one of the top-grossing films of
the year. Playboy Magazine  appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed
magazines such as Penthouse Magazine  and Hustler Magazine .
By the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the
AIDS epidemic  helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in
numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay  in the US, declined as pornographic
movies would lar gely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.
Crime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a
complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious
cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital
punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later .
The Second-W ave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had
begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role
within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth
Amendment to the United States Constitution  (which legalized female
suffrage ) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality
and other protests.
1971 saw Erin Pizzey  establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in
Chiswick , London and Pizze y and her colleagues opened further facilities
throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in
other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in Amsterdam  in 1974.[29][30]Sexual revolution
Crime and urban decay
FeminismWith the anthology Sister hood is Powerful  and other works, such as Sexual Politics , being published at the start of
the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before. In addition, the Supreme Court 's 1973
decision of Roe v. Wade, which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement
into the national political spotlight.
Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan , Betty Ford , Shirley Chisholm , Bella Abzug , Robin Morgan, Kate Millett  and
Elizabeth Holtzman , among many others, led the movement for women's equality .
Even musically , the women's movement  had its shining moment. Australian-American singer Helen Reddy , recorded
the song "I Am Woman ", which became an anthem for the women's liberation movement . "I Am Woman" reached
No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.
Another movement to arise was the 1970s Goddess movement , which took place to combat patriarchal ideas of
religion.[31][32]
Most efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws,
were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained
unheard of success in business, politics, education, science, the law, and even the home . Although most aims of the
movement were successful, however , there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the
Equal Rights Amen dment  to the U.S. Cons titution  with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify
ERA  in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the wage
gap failed to close, but it did become smaller .
The second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982  with the failure of the Equal Rights
Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C.. American women created a brief, but
powerful, third-wave  in the early 1990s which addressed sexual harassment  (inspired by the Anita Hill–Clarence
Thomas  Senate Judiciary Committee  hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of
such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, particularly the United

The Civil Rights Movement  of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves
more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist  movement grew out of frustrations with
the "non-v iolent" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr. and June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy , many Black peopl e were compelled to reject ideas of
negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil
Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the "woman's turn", though many feminists incorporated civil rights
ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership positio n of the civil rights movement from
her husband, Coretta Scott King , as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping
and encou raging the Woman's Liberation  movemen t, and other movements as well. At the National Women's
Conference  in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in
the movem ent's goals. Similarly , the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of
political figures such as Harvey Milk to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation
passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including Freddie Mercury  and Andy Warhol , also
"came out " during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.Civil rights
Youth suffrageThe Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution  was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting
age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact
that young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War before they were old enough to vote.[33]

the world's best-selling
automobiles at the time. 
Pong, created by Atari Inc. in
1972, is one of the earliest
arcade video games and was
the first electronic sports video
game. Other games like
Breakout, Galaxian, Asteroids
and Space Invaders also helped
define the decade in gaming
culture. 
Four Olympic Games were held
in the 1970s, Sapporo and
Munich in 1972, Innsbruck and
Montreal in 1976 (all during the
Cold War, and prompting
significant events like the
Munich massacre in 1972 and
the African-led boycott in 1976).
New Hollywood films like Jaws,
Star Wars, The Godfather, The
Exorcist, Grease, and Rocky as
well as Superman, Saturday
Night Fever, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, and Willy Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory were
all extremely popular during the

Disco balls and roller skating
trends were popular and widely
used in nightclubs and roller
rinks in the 1970s. Songs like
Bee Gee's "Stayin' Alive" and
ABBA's "Dancing Queen" were
played during the decade.
During the early 1970s, popular music continued to be dominated by musicians  who had achieved fame during the
1950s and the 1960s such as the Rolling Stones, The Who , Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Conway
Twitty , Bob Dylan , The Grate ful Dead , and Eric Clapt on. In addition, many newcomer rock groups such as Black
Sabbath  and Led Zeppelin  appeared. The Beatles  disbanded in 1970, but each member of the band immediatelyMusicBritish rock band Led Zeppelin was one
of the most popular and influential
bands of the 1970s. The band's heavy,
guitar-driven sound has led them to be
cited as one of the progenitors of heavy
metal.released a highly successful solo album, and Paul McC artney  especially would remain extremely popular throughout
the decade. Singer -songwriters such as Elton John , James Taylor  and Jackson Browne  also came into vogue during
the early 1970s.
The 1970s saw the rapid commercialization of rock music, and by mid-decade there were a spate of bands derisively
dubbed "corporate rock" due to the notion that they had been created by record  labels to produce simplistic, radio-
friendly songs that offered clichés rathe r than meaningful lyrics. Such bands included The Doob ie Brothers , Bread ,
Styx, Kansas , and REO Speedwagon .
Funk , an offshoot of soul music with a greater emph asis on beats, and influences from rhythm and blues , jazz, and
psychedelic rock, was also very popular . The mid-1970s also saw the rise of disco  musi c, which dominated during
the last half of the decade with bands like the Bee Gees, Chic , ABBA , Village People , Boney M, Donna Summer ,
KC and the Sunshin e Band , and others. In response to this, rock music became increasingly hard-edged, with early
metal artists like Led Zeppelin , Jimi Hendrix , Black Sabbath , and Deep Purple . Minimalism  also emer ged, led by
composers such as Philip Glass , Steve Reich  and Michael Nyman . This was a break from the intellectual serial
music in the tradition of Schoenber g, which lasted from the early 1900s to the 1960s.
The 1970s also saw artists from Motown records  beco me popular across the globe. Artists like the Jackson 5, Stevie
Wonder  and Marvin Gaye  dominated the record charts across the world and had a significant influence on pop
culture, including breaking down racial barriers.[34]
Classical and experimental music influenced both art rock and progressive
rock genres with bands such as Pink Floyd , Yes, Todd Rund gren's Utopia ,
Supertramp , Rush , Genesis , King Crimson , Emerson, Lake & Palmer ,
Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues  and Soft Machine . Hard rock and Heavy
metal  also emer ged amon g British bands Led Zeppe lin, Queen , The Who ,
Black Sabbath, UFO , Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and Judas Priest .
Australian band AC/DC  also found its hard-rock origins in the early 1970s
and its breakthrough  in 1979's Highway to Hell, while popular American
rock bands included Aerosmith , Lynyrd Skynyrd  and shock rockers  Alice
Cooper , Blue Öyster Cult, and Kiss, and guitar -oriented Ted Nugent  and
Van Halen . In Europe, there was a surge of popularity in the early decade
for glam rock .
After a successful return to live perfor ming in the late 60s with his TV
special , Elvis Presley  regained his popularity through Vegas performance
engagements and concert tours throughout the United States until his
death in 1977, which  helped him reach a new generation of fans. His 1973
televised concert, Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite , aired in over 40
countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, making it one of the most popular concert events of the
decade.
The second half of the decade saw the rise of punk rock, when a spate of fresh, young rock groups playing stripped-
down hard rock came to prominence at a time when most of the artists associated with the 1960s to early 1970s were
in creative decline. Punk bands included The Sex Pistols , The Clash , The Ramones , Talking Heads , and more.
The highe st-selling album of the decade was Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon  (1973), along with Eagles '
Hotel California  (1976) and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours  (1977). Dark Side of the Moon  remained on the Billboar d
200 albums chart for 741 weeks. Electronic instrumental progressive rock was particularly significant in continental
Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk , Tangerine Dream , Can, and Faust  to circumvent the language barrier . Their
synthesiser -heavy "krautrock ", along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music),
would be a major influence on subsequent synthrock .[35] The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art music
musicians such as Jean-Michel Jarre , Vangelis , and Tomita , who with Brian Eno were a significant influence of thePink Floyd performing The Dark Side of
the Moon in 1973, the highest-selling
album of the decade and one of the
highest-selling of all time.
British rock band Queen (pictured
here in 1977) was considered to be
one of the most influential bands of
the '70s (as well as the '80s), along
with American rock band Eagles and
othersdevelopment of new-age music . Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra
helped to pioneer synthpop, with their self-titled album  (in 1978 ) setting a
template with less minimalism and with a strong emphasis on melody , and
drawing from a wider range of influences than had been employed by
Kraftwerk . YMO  also introduced the microprocessor -based Roland MC-8
sequencer and TR-808  rhythm machine to popular music.
In the first half of the 1970s, many jazz musicians from the Miles Davis
school achieved cross-over success through jazz-rock fusion  with bands
like Weather Report , Return to Forever , The Headhunters  and The
Mahavishnu Orches tra who also influenced this genre and many others. In
Germany , Manfred Eicher  started the ECM  label, which quickl y made a
name for "chamber jazz". Towards the end of the decade, Jamaican reggae
music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s,
became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe, mostly because of reggae superstar and legend Bob Marley . The
mid-1970s saw the reemer gence of acoustic jazz with the return of artists like Dexter Gordon  to the US music scene,
who, along with a number of other artists, such as trumpet innovators like Don Ellis and Woody Shaw, who were
among the last of the decade's traditionally-oriented acoustic jazz musicians to be signed to major record labels, to
receive critical and widespread commercial recognition and multiple Grammy nominations.
The late 1970s also saw the beginning of hip hop music with disc jockeys
like DJ Kool Herc  and Afrika Bambaataa  taking loops from funk and soul
records and playing them repeatedly at block parties and dance clubs. At the
end of the 1970s, popular songs like "Rapper's Delight " by Sugarhill Gang
gave hip hop a wider audience. Hip hop was also influenced by the song
"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised " by Gil Scott-Heron .
Country music also continued to increase in popularity in the 1970s. Between
1977 and 1979, it became more mainstream, particularly with the outlaw
movement , led by Waylon Jennings  and Willie Nelson. The 70s also saw the
rise of a country music subgenre, southern rock, led by the Allman Brothers
Band . Other artists; such as Conway Twitty , Loretta Lynn, Don Williams ,
Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Ronnie Milsap , Crystal Gayle, and Barbara
Mandrell ; all scored hits throughout the 70s which reached both country and
pop charts . The genre also saw its golden age of vocal duos  and groups  in this decade; with Conway Twitty  and
Loretta Lynn, Geor ge Jones  and Tammy Wynette , Jim Ed Brown  and Helen Cornelius , the Bellamy Brothers , the
Oak Ridge Boys , the Statler Brothers , Dave & Sugar , and The Kendalls . The genre also became more involved in
Hollywood  towa rd the end of the decade, with country-themed action films such as Smokey and the Bandit  and
Every Which W ay But Loose , a trend that continued into the early 80s with Urban Cowboy  and Bronco Billy .
A major event in music in the early 1970s was the deaths of popular rock stars Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , and Jim
Morrison , all at the age of 27. Two of popular music's most successful artists from other eras died within eight
weeks of each other in 1977. Elvis Presley, the best-selling singer of all time, died on August 16, 1977.[36] Presley's
funeral was held at Graceland , on Thurs day, Augu st 18, 1977. Bing Cros by, who sold about 50 million records, died
on Octobe r 14, 1977. His single, White Christmas , remains the best-selling single of all time, confirmed by the
Guinness Records .[37]
In additio n to the deaths in the 1970s,  breakups of bands and duos; such as the Beatle s, Simon and Garfunk el,
Creedence Clearwater Revival , the Everly Brothers , and others; occurred over the course of the decade.
Statistically , Led Zeppelin and Elton John were the most successful musical acts of the 1970s, both having sold
more than 300 million records since 1969.[38][39]Bruce Lee fostered the popularity of
martial arts cinema
Salah Zulfikar and Zubaida
Tharwat in The Other Man (1973)During the 1970s, Japan had the second largest music market in the world.[40] Popular music  included kayōkyoku ,
idols , new music , rock and enka . Musical artists and bands included Momoe Yamaguchi , Saori Minami , the Candies ,
Pink Lady , Hiromi Go , Hideki Saijo , Yuming , Saki Kubota , Judy Ongg  and Sachiko Kobayashi .
Oscar winners of the decade were Patton  (1970), The French Connection
(1971), The Godfather  (1972), The Sting  (1973), The Godfather Part II
(1974), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), Rocky  (1976), Annie Hall
(1977), The Deer Hunter  (1978), and Kramer vs. Kramer  (1979).
The top ten highest- grossing films of the decade are (in order from highest to
lowest grossing): Star Wars, Jaws , Grease, The Exorcist, Close Encounters of
the Third Kind , Superman , The Godfather , Satur day Night Fever , Rocky , and
Jaws 2 .[41] Two of these movies came out on the same day: June 16, 1978.
In 1970s European cinema , the failure of the Prague Spring brought about
nostalgic motion pictures such as István Szabó 's Szerelmesfilm  (1970).
German New Wave and Rainer Fassbinder 's existential movies characterized film- making in Germany . The movies
of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman  reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like Cries and
Whispers  (1973).
Airport  was relea sed in 1970, spawning the air disaster film genre. Throughout the decade, the film inspired three
sequels: Airport 1975 , Airport '77, and The Concor de... Airport '79. The genre also inspired a spoof film (Airplane! )
along with its two sequels in the early 1980s. A slew of other air disaster films followed suit throughout the 1980s
and well into the 1990s, primarily in made-for -TV movies.
Car chase  movies also became a popular film genre of the 1970s with such films as Dirty Mary , Crazy Larry  in
1974, and perhaps the genre's most popular film Smokey and the Bandit  in 1977.
Asian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and
struggles. In the Bollywood  cinema of India, this was epitomize d by the
movies of Bollywood superhero Amitabh Bachchan . Another Asian touchstone
beginning in the early 1970s was Hong Kong martial arts film which sparked a
greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. Martial arts film
reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, Bruce
Lee. During the 1970s, Hollywood continu ed the New Hollywood  movement
of the late-1960s with young filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola , Geor ge
Lucas , Martin Scorsese  and Steven Spielber g, as well as films like Apocalypse
Now, The Godfather , Star Wars, Taxi Driver , Jaws , and Close Encounters of
the Third Kind . Top-grossing Jaws  (1975) ushered in the blockbuster  era of
filmmaking, though  it was eclipsed two years later by the science-fiction film
Star Wars (1977). Satur day Night Fever  (1977) single-handedly touched off disco mania in the U.S. The Godfather
(1972) was also one of the decade's greatest successes and its first follow-up, The Godfather Part II (1974) was also
successful for a sequel.
The Rocky Horr or Picture Show  flopped in its 1975 debut, only to reappear as a more-popular midnight show later
in the decade. Still in limited release decades after its premiere, it is the longe st-running theatrical release in film
history .
The Exor cist (1973) was a box office success for the horror genre, inspiring many other so-called "devil (Satan)"
films like The Omen  and both of their own sequels. The release of the movie followed a general mood of paranoia
on satanic themes in the United States; also the counterculture of the 1970s saw an increasing interest inFilmoccultism .[42]
All That Jazz (1979) gained high critical praise, winning four Oscars and several other awards. It was an inductee of
the 2001 National Film Registry  list.[43]
The Golden Age of Porn  continued  its reign throughout the 1970s, with one of its most popular films of the decade
being Debbie Does Dallas  in 1978.
In the United Kingdom, colour chann els were now available; three stations had begun broadcasting in colour
between 1967 and 1969. However , many viewers continued to watch black-and-white television sets for most of the
decade, which meant for example that televised snooker  (in which the colour of balls is important) did not reach the
heights of its popularity until the 1980s.
Notable dramas included Play for Today  and Pennies from Heaven . In police dramas, there was a move towards
increasing realism; popular shows included Dixon of Dock Gr een, Z-Cars , Softly , Softly , and The Sweeney .
The science fiction show Doctor Who  reached its peak.
1970s UK television featured a mix of traditional more modern comedies and sitcoms. Fawlty Towers , Morecambe
and Wise, The Benny Hill Show , Are You Being Served?  and Dad's Army  had their origins in the variety show and
radio comedy of the first half of the century . Many popular British situation comedies  (sit-coms) were gentle,
unchallenging come dies of middle-class life; typical examples were Terry and June  and Sykes . However , the
middle-class settings of The Good Life and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin  contrasted with their anti-
establishment theme of people rejecting traditional social norms. A harsher side of society was shown by comedy
series like Porridge  and Rising Damp, while sitcoms such as Mind Your Language , Love Thy Neighbou r and Till
Death Us Do Part reflected social unease brought about by post-war immigration. Spike Milligan 's Q and the still-
popular Monty Python's Flying Cir cus both used surreal comedy , originating from the 1950s The Goon Show .
During the 1970s, the original animated television series Roobarb  and Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk .
The television information retrieval service Teletext  was initially introdu ced when the BBC Ceefax  system went live
on 23 September 1974.
In the late 1970s, BBC2's unveiled a new identity , a twin-striped "2", which was the first electronically generated
symbol and scrolled on and of f the screen.
As the 1970s began, the Big Three TV networks were rapidly re-engineering their lineups, noting that existing
programs were not attracting the youth audience. Most existing programs still operated on paradigms established in
the 1950s,  and some shows had literally been on the air since the dawn of TV broadcasting in the late 1940s and
early 1950 s. Shows that had low ratings or insuf ficient youth appeal were cance lled as networks scrambled to attract
the lar ge baby boomer  audience.
To reflect the new social trends, television changed dramatically with more urban and edgy settings, and replaced
the popular rural/country wholesome look of the 1950s and 1960s, seen as outmoded and unable to connect with
young, educated urban audiences. This particular trend was known as the rural purge. Television was transformed by
what became termed as "social consciousness" programming, such as All in the Family  and Soap , which broke down
television barriers. Many advertising trends of the 1970s also reflected this grow ing social consciousness trend, such
as with Coca-Cola's "Give the World a Coke" and Mcdonalds' "Y ou Deserve a Break" campaigns.[44]Television

United StatesRedd Foxx and Demond Wilson
from Sanford and SonThe wome n's movement ushered in a slew of programming featuring strong,
independent females as central characters. Most notable was The Mary Tyler
Moor e Show , which spawned the successful spin-of fs Rhoda  and Phyllis , and
also resulted in Mary Tyler Moore becoming the first female to head a
television production company of her own, MTM Enterprises , which churned
out groundbreaking  programming in the late 1970s throughout the 1990s.
Women were also established portraying action characters in programs like
Police W oman , Wonder W oman , The Bionic W oman , and others.
Minority-centric television programming also featured prominently during
the 1970s.  Shows featuring African-Americans as main characters, such as
Sanfor d and Son, Maude , The Jeffer sons, Good Times, Roots  and What's
Happening!!  broke down barriers  and became very popular . In addition, Soul
Train, the brain child of Don Cornelius , premiered in 1971  as the African-
American counterpa rt to American Bandstand , giving a forum for soul, funk,
jazz, R&B , disco , and future rap and hip hop artists to gain exposure to
American audiences, consumers, music lovers, enthusiasts, and those keen on
learning new dance moves.
The televi sion western , which had been very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, all but died out during the 1970s, with
Bonanza , The Virginian , and Gunsmoke  ending their runs. Replacing westerns were police and detective shows, a
trend that would last through the 1980s.
Television still had its medical shows of the 1970s, however , Emer gency!  was the first popular medical drama  ever
to feature both the paramedic program as well as the hospital emer gency department, which also encouraged future
people in the United States to develop their own paramedic program or hospital emer gency department, and acted as
an inspiration for many individuals. Marcus Welby, M.D.  and Medical Center  were other long-ru nning medical
dramas popular during the 1970s.
1950s nostalgia became a theme in prime time sitcoms with the Garry Marshall -produced Happy Days  and its two
spin-of fs Laverne & Shirley  and Mork & Mindy .
By the mid-to-late 1970s, "jiggle television "—programs oriented toward sexual gratification and farce  comedy and
situations—became popular . Such progr ams included Charlie's Angels , The Love Boat , and perhaps the genre's most
popular , Three's Company .
Soap operas expanded their audiences beyond housewives  with the rise of All My Childr en, As the World Turns,
Somerset , and The Young and the Restless ; with many extendin g their episodes from 30 minutes to an hour. The soap
Another World began a 16-month experiment in March  1979 by screening 90-minute episodes , the only serial to do
so.
Game shows  such as Match Game , The Hollywood Squar es, Family Feud , and many others, saw their golden ages
on daytime television . The height of Match Game 's popularity occurred between 1973 and 1977, before it was
overtaken by Family Feud  in 1978. Television's current longest-running game show , The Price Is Right , began its
run hosted by Bob Barker  in 1972.
Another influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s.
The science fiction phenomenon of the late 1970s that began with Star Wars went  to television with shows such as
Battlestar Galactica .
Variety shows , a staple of TV programming since the beginning, were also re-engineered to appeal to young
viewers. Old standb ys such as The Ed Sullivan Show  and The Red Skelton Show  were canceled and replaced by
hipper programming like Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour  and Donny & Marie . The Carol Burnett Show  also endedits historic  11-year run in 1978. In the end, rising production costs largely did in variety shows. The exception was
Satur day Night Live (then known as NBC's Satur day Night ), which was created by Lorne Michaels  and premiered in
1975, with an original cast of Laraine Newman , John Belushi , Jane Curtin , Gilda Radner , Dan Aykroyd , Garrett
Morris , and Chevy Chase .
The Duke s of Hazzar d began its six-year run in 1979. The series was inspired by the car-chase film genre,
particularly the 1975 film Moonrunners , on which  the series was based, with similar characters and scenes; and both
were directed by Gy Waldron .
As cable television became more affordable and accessible by U.S. consumers, the race to bring the silver screen to
the small screen commenced with the launch of pay television  services showing premium content.
HBO  launched on November 8, 1972, becoming the nation's first pay-television channel. On September 30, 1975,
HBO became the first television networ k to continuously deliver signals via satellite when it showed the "Thrilla in
Manila " boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier .
Star Channel launched its service offerings nationally in 1973 through the delivery of movies on videotapes for
cable providers to broadcast. This proved problematic since the videotapes were often riddled with technical
difficulties. Star Channel eventually was linked up to satellite in January 1978. Shortly after, Warner
Communications acquired the channel and relaunched it on December 1, 1979 , in its current form as The Movie
Channel .
Media giant Viacom  launched their premium service, Showtime , nationally on July 1, 1976, after a brief, wildly
successful test launch on their cable system in Dublin, California .[45]
In 1974, Australian TV tested color transmissions (full-time color came in 1975). Popular shows during the decade
include, Young Talent Time, Number 96, The Aunty Jack Show, Class of '74, The Sullivans , The Don Lane Show ,
Cop Shop , The Naked V icar Show , The Paul Hogan Show  and Countdown .
South Africa saw nationwide television service for the first time on January 5, 1976, although limited-view , locally
available television began on May 5, 1975.

The Sears Tower
became the world's
tallest building when
completed in 1973.As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They
would form  what would become known  as the counterculture . The form s of escape and resistance would manifest in
many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and
alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a frisbee .[48] What started with a few players like Victor
Malafronte, Z Weyand and Ken Westerfield  experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a frisbee, later
would become known as playing freestyle .[49] Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts
from Wham-O  and Irwin Toy (Canada),  a few tournaments and professionals using frisbee show tours to perform at
universities, fairs and sporting events.[50] Disc sports such as freestyle, double disc court , guts, disc ultimate  and
disc golf  became this sports first events.[51][52]
Fiction in the early 1970s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling, especially with Erich Segal 's Love Story .
The seven ties also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as Saul Bello w and Peter De Vries,
who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Racism remained a key literary subject. John
Updike  emer ged as a major literary figure. Reflections on the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of
the decade  through the works of Joyce Caro l Oates  and Wright Morris. With the rising cost of hard-cover books and
the increa sing reade rship of "genre fiction", the paperback became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also
became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in Kurt Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions , were common
literary elements. The horror genre also emer ged, and by the late 1970s Stephen King had becom e one of the most
popular genre novelists . The postmodern  author Thomas Pynchon  published  his most famous work, Gravity's
Rainbow , in 1973.
In non-fiction, several books related to Nixon and the Watergate scandal  topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought
many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of Virginia Woolf, Agatha Christie , and
J. R. R. Tolkien .
The fake mem oir Go Ask Alice  was released in 1971. Upon its initial release the book was marketed as a real diary
of a teenage girl who overdosed in the 1960s. However , it was later revealed that the book was actually written by
Beatrice Sparks .
Architecture in the 1970s began as a continuation of styles created by
such archi tects as Frank Lloyd Wright  and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe .
Early in the decade , several architects competed to build the tallest
building in the world. Of these buildings, the most notable are the John
Hancock Center  and Sears Tower  in Chicag o, both designed by Bruce
Graham  and Fazlur Khan, and the World Trade Center  towers in New
York by American architect Minoru Yamasaki . The decade also brought
experimentation in geometric design, pop-art , postmodernism , and
early deconstructivism .
Design trends in the 1970s were marked by a backlash against the
bright colors and futurism of the 1950s and 1960s and a rise in
popularity of dark, earthy tones with extensive use of brown, green,
purple, and orange. Wood decor and paneling was integral to 1970s
interior design as well, replacing the obsession of the 1950s and 1960s
with chrome and aluminum. Darker colors not only reflected the back-to-nature mindset of the decade, but the
sluggish world economy with its lowered optimism and expectations for the future.Literature
ArchitectureThe CN Tower
was completed
in 1976,
becoming the
world's tallest
free-standing
structure.In 1974, Louis Kahn's last and arguably most famous building, the National Assembly Building
of Dhaka , Bangladesh, was completed. The building's use of open spaces and groundbreaking
geometry brought rare attention to the small South Asian country . Hugh Stubbins's Citicorp
Center  revolutionized the incorporation of solar panels in office buildings. The seventies
brought further experimentation in glass and steel construction and geometric design. Chinese
architect I. M. Pei's John Hancock Tower  in Boston , Massachusetts, is an example, althoug h
like many  buildings of the time, the experimentation was flawed and glass panes fell from the
façade. In 1976, the completed CN Tower  in Toronto became the world's tallest free-standing
structure on land, an honor it held until 2007. The fact that no taller tower had been built
between the construction of the CN Tower and the Burj Khalifa  shows how innovative the
architecture and engineering of the structure truly were.
Modern architecture was increasingly criticized as the decade went on from the point of view of
postmodern architects, such as Philip Johnson , Charles Moore, and Michael Graves , who
advocated a return to pre-modern styles of architecture and the incorporation of pop elements as
a means of communicating with a broader public. Other architects, such as Peter Eisenman  of
the New York Five , advocated the pursuit of form for the sake of form and drew on semiotics theory for support.
"High Tech" architecture moved forward  as Buckminster Fuller  continued his exper iments in geodesic domes , while
the Geor ges Pompidou Center , designed by Renzo Piano  and Richard Rogers , which opened in 1977, was a
prominent example.  As the decade drew to a close, Frank Gehry broke out in a new direction with his own house in
Santa Monica, a highly complex structure, half excavated out of an existing bungalow and half cheaply built
construction using materials such as chicken wire fencing.
Terracotta Army  figures, dating from 210 BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District,
Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (Chinese: 秦始皇陵 ; pinyin: Qín
Sh ǐhuáng Ling). In 1978, electrical work ers in Mexico City found the remains of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan
in the middle of the city .
Clothing styles during the 1970s were influenced by outfits seen in popular music groups and in Hollywood
films.[53] In clothing, prints, especially from India and other parts of the world, were fashionable.[53]
Much of the 1970s fashion styles were influenced by the hippie movement . As well as the hippie look, the 70s also
gave way to glam rock styles, started off by David Bowie  who was named the King of Glam Rock. Glam was a
genderbent  and outlandish style.
Significant fashion trends of the 1970s include:
Bell-bottomed pants  remained popular throughout the decade. These combined with turtle necked
shirts  and flower-prints to form the characteristic 1970s look. In the later part of the decade, this gave
way to three-piece suits, in large part because of the movie Saturday Night Fever .
Sideburns  were popular for men, particularly mutton chops; as were beards  and mustaches  which had
been out of fashion since the 19th and early 20th century .
Women's hairstyles went from long and straight in the first half of the decade to the feathery cut of
Farrah Fawcett , a trend that continued through the first half of the 1980s.
Miniskirts  and minidresses  were still popular in the first half of the decade, particularly with pleated
"rah-rah" skirts with higher hemlines; but they were quickly phased out by the mid-70s in favor of hot
pants . However , miniskirts and minidresses never totally went away , and they made a return to
mainstream fashion in the mid-1980s and has remained a fashion staple in the decades since.
Crop tops  and hot pants  became popular summer outfits among young women and teenage girls in
the second half of the decade.
