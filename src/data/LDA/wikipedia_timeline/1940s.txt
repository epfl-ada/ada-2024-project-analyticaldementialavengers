1940s
The 1940s  (pronounced "nineteen-forties" and commonly
abbreviated as "the '40s" or "the Forties ") was a decade
that began on Januar y 1, 1940, and ended on December 31,
1949.
Most of World War II took place in the first half of the
decade, which had a profound effect on most countries and
people in Europe , Asia, and elsewhere. The consequences
of the war lingered well into the second  half of the decade,
with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling
spheres of influence  of the Western world and the Soviet
Union , leading to the beginning of the Cold War. To some
degree internal and external tensions in the post-war  era
were managed by new institutions, including the United
Nations , the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system ,
facilitating the post–W orld War II economic expansion ,
which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the
post-war world encouraged decolonization  and the
emer gence of new states and governments, with India ,
Pakistan , Israel , Vietnam , and others declaring
independence, altho ugh rarely without bloodshed. The
decade also witne ssed the early beginnings of new
technologies (such as computers , nuclear power , and jet
propulsion ), often first developed in tandem with the war
effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war
era.
The world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5
billion over the course of the decade, with about 850
million births and 600 million deaths in total.World War II

II, a program of systematic state-sponsored extermination by
Nazi Germany , under Adolf Hitler , its allies , and
collaborators .[2] Some scholars maintain that the definition of
the Holocaust should also include the Nazis' systematic
murder of millions of people in other groups, including ethnic
Poles , the Romani , Soviet civilians , Soviet prisoners of war ,
people with disabilities , gay men , and political and religious
opponents .[3] By this definition, the total number of Holocaust

and Notorious  directed by Alfred Hitchcock , (1946). The Walt
Disney Studios  released the animated feature films Pinocchio
(1940), Dumbo  (1941), Fantasia  (1940), and Bambi  (1942).
Although the 1940s was a decade domin ated by World War II, important and
noteworthy films about a wide variety of subjects were made during that era.
Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the
1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-
time great films. European cinema  survived although obviously curtailed
during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the United
Kingdom , France , Italy, the Soviet Union  and elsew here in Europe. The
cinema of Japan  also survi ved. Akira Kurosawa  and other  directors managed
to produce significant films during the 1940s.
Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith (1943) about current nazi crimes
in occupied Europe during the war and about lies of nazi propaganda.[6]
Film Noir, a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during the
decade. Films such as The Maltese Falcon  and The Big Sleep  are considered class ics and helped launch the careers
of legenda ry actors such as Humphrey Bogart  and Ava Gardn er. The genre has been widely copied since its initial
inception.
In France during the war the tour de force Childr en of Paradise  directed by Marcel Carné (1945), was shot in Nazi
occupied Paris.[7][8][9] Memorable films from post-war England include David Lean 's Great Expectations  (1946 )
and Oliver Twist (1948 ), Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947 ) and The Third Man (1949 ), and Powell and
Pressbur ger's A Matter of Life and Death  (1946 ), Black Narcissus  (1946 ) and The Red Shoes  (1948 ), Laurence
Olivier 's Hamlet , the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture  and Kind Hearts and
Coronets  (1949 ) directed by Robert Hamer . Italian neorealism  of the 1940s produced poignant movies made in post-
war Italy. Roma, città aperta  directed by Roberto Rossellini  (1945), Sciuscià  directed by Vittorio De Sica (1946),
Paisà  directed by Roberto Rossellini (1946), La terra trema directed by Luchino Visconti  (1948), The Bicycle Thief
directed by Vittorio De Sica (1948), and Bitter Rice directed by Giuseppe De Santis  (1949), are some well-known
examples.Popular  cultur e

The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (1945), and the post-war Drunken Angel  (1948), and Stray Dog (1949),
directed by Akira Kurosawa  are considered important early works leading to his first masterpieces of the 1950s.
Drunken Angel  (1948), marked the beginning of the successful collaboration between Kurosa wa and actor Toshiro
Mifune  that lasted until 1965.
Bing Crosby  was the best selling pop artist of the 1940s. Crosby was
the leading figure of the crooner sound as well as its most iconic,
defining artist. By the 1940s, he was an entertainment superstar who
mastered all of the major media formats of the day , movies, radio,
and recorded music.
The most popular music style during the 1940s was swing , which
prevailed during W orld W ar II. In the later periods of the 1940s, less
swing was prominent and crooners like Frank Sinatra , along with
genres such as bebop and the earliest traces of rock and roll, were
the prevalent genre.

Because fashion items and fabrics were rationed  due to World War II, fashion
became more utilitarian. Women's fashion started including suits, which were
feminized with straight knee-length skirts and accessories. There were challe nges
imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather , rubber , metal (for snaps,
buckles, and embell ishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in
any one garment.  After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the
United States almost entirely , with the exception of a few trends coming from
wartorn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force . The
idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the
end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages
controlled import items such as silk and furs. Floral prints dominated the early
1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as
"atomic prints" or geometric patterns and shapes. In response to the war effort,
patriotic nautical themes and dark green s and khakis dominating the color palettes, as
trousers and wedges  slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due toMusic

During the 1940s, sporting events were disrupted and changed by the events that engaged and shaped the entire
world. The 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games  were cancelled because of World War II. During World War II in the
United States Heavyweight Boxing Champion  Joe Louis  and numerous stars and performers from American
baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players
(including well known stars) who served during World War II were Moe Berg, Joe DiMaggio , Bob Feller , Hank
Greenber g, Stan Musial  (in 1945), Warren Spahn , and Ted Williams . They like many others sacrificed their personal
and valuable career time for the benefit and well-being of the rest of society . The Summer Olympics were resumed
in 1948 in London  and the Winter games were held that year in St. Moritz , Switzerland .
In 1947, Wataru Misaka  of the New York Knicks  became the first person of color to play in modern professional
basketball, just months after Jackie Robinson  had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball  for the
Brooklyn Dodgers .[11]
During the early 1940s World War II had an enormous impact on Major Leag ue Baseball as many players including
many of the most successful stars joined the war effort. After the war many players returned to their teams, while the
major even t of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of Jackie Robinson  to a playe rs contract by Branch

During the mid-1930s and throughout the years leading up to the 1940s Joe Louis
was an enormously popular Heavyweight boxer . In 1936, he lost an important 12
round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer Max Schmeling  and he vowed to
meet Schm eling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schm eling
became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy
against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmelin g out
in the first few secon ds of the first round during their rematch at Yankee Stadium , his
sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the U.S.
Army  on January 10, 1942 , in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Louis'
cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first
African American  to achieve  the status of a nationwide hero within the United States,
and was also a focal  point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War
II.[12]

millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during W orld W ar II. The Germans called this
"the final solution to the Jewish question ..."

"The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in
World W ar II." Also see "The Holocaust", Encyclopædia Britannica , 2007: "the systematic state-
sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women and children, and millions of others, by Nazi
Germany and its collaborators during W orld W ar II. The Germans called this "the final solution to the
Jewish question".

4. Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths, would produce a
death toll of 17 million. [1] (https://books.google.com/books?id=lpDTIUklB2MC&pg=PP1#PP A45,M1)
Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary
between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of total war  is
unclear . Overall, about 5.7 million (78 percent) of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe perished
(Gilbert, Martin . Atlas of the Holocaust  1988, pp. 242–244). Compared to five to 11 million (1.4
percent to 3.0 percent) of the 360 million non-Jews in German-dominated Europe. Small, Melvin and
