The River  is a 1984  American  drama film directed by
Mark Rydell , written by Rober t Dillon and Julian
Barry , and starring Sissy Spacek, Mel Gibs on, and
Scott Glen n. The film tells the story of a struggling
farm family in a Tennessee  river valley trying to keep
its farm from going under in the face of bank
foreclosures and floods. The father faces the dilemma
of having to work as a strikebreaker  in a steel mill to
keep his family farm from foreclosure. It was based on
the true story of farmers who unknowingly took jobs as
strikebreakers at a steel mill after their crops had been
destroyed by rain.
The River  was theatrically released on December 19,

and the cinematography , but criticizing the screenplay ,
execution, and Gibson's performance, whom many
considered to have been miscast . It was a box office
failure, grossing only $11.5 million against an $18
million budget. Despite that, it received four
nominations at the 57th Academy Awards ; Best Actress
(for Spacek), Best Original Score , Best Sound , Best
Cinematography , and won the Special Achievement
Award .
Tom and Mae Garvey are a hard-working couple living
with their two children on the east Tennessee farm
owned by Tom's family for generations. They and
many of their neigh bors have hit hard times as of late.
A downturn in the economy has led to dwindling land
prices.
Their biggest problem has been that their crop land has
been prone to flooding as the property is adjacent to a
river. Manipulating the powers that be include local
senator Neiswinder and the local bank. Joe Wade, who
also grew up in the area and now runs the local milling
company that sets the local grain prices, is secretlyPlotBox office $11.5 million (North
America)[2]working to buy up the properties along the river so he
can build a dam. The dam would generate electricity
but more importantly for Wade, it would provide
irrigation opportunities for farm properties away from the river , such as his own.
Wade's maneuverings coupled with many other farming problems makes it increasingly difficult for Tom
and Mae to hold on to their farm. Tom is determined at any cost stay on the land of his ancestors.
Through his cousin, Tom begins work at a steel factory in order to prevent foreclosure on his farm, only
finding out he's a strikebreaker as they're crossing the picket lines. Work in the mill is incredibly hard, the
conditions are tough and pay is meager .
The rest of the Garv ey family is left alone while Tom is away working. Mae is involved in an accident on
the farm where she loses a lot of blood  and almost her arm. Some time later, Tom invites his family to
come visit him in the city where he and Mae compare how things are going in their daily lives now spent
apart. The strike ends, but as part of the returning workers' deal, the strike breakers must walk out of the
factory without the protection they had when entering. Instead of an all-out fight, the workers and scabs
observe one another , recognizing each others' desperation before the workers begin shaming the scabs.
Tom retur ns to the farm and is pleased with the crops but Wade has Tom's corn inspected. Wade offers
less than what the crop cost Tom to plant which leads to a confrontation where Wade reveals his plans for
a hydroele ctric dam and the redevelopment of Tom's land. Tom returns to the farm where his machinery is
failing and another flood threatens the farm.
An exhaus ted Mae finally confronts Tom over his stubbornness, as he is continu ing to fight a losing battle
with Wade and the river. The farming community bands together to build a levee providing some relief.
Wade arrives with a truck full of bankrupt farmers intent on dismantling the levee for cash. Wade offers
the farmers on Tom's side a bonus if they sabotage the levee. Tom pleads with both sides, many of whom
were in Tom's shoes but lost their farms, however the levee is breached and the floodwaters flow in.
Despite all of this, Tom begins picking up sandbags to repair the levee alone. Inspired by his dedication,
his family and eventually , the onlookers  help Tom repair the levee. Wade realizes he's lost the battle and
admires Tom's determination, but points out that sooner or later nature will upend Tom's farm and Wade
will be waiting.The Garvey family has a successful harvest.

Director Mark Rydell  viewed the characters in this drama as iconicly American, and he was eager to cast
Sissy Spacek  as the farm wife because of her performance in Coal Miner's Daughter  and her home on a
farm near Charlottesville, Virginia . Rydell said, "She is the consummate American rural young woman,
with stren gth and fiber and a luminous quality ." Mel Gibson  begg ed Rydell to let him play the Tennessee
farmer who reminded him of his father , but the director was reluctant because of Gibson's Australian
accent. Before Gibson left for England  to film The Bount y, he begged Rydell not to cast the part yet.
Rydell recalled, "He came back to my house in Los Angeles  and started reading the script, talking,
reading the newspaper , in this perfect Tennessee accent. I was really impressed, even when he stood next
to Sissy , who's like a tuning fork when it comes to accents, he had damn well done it."
The River  was filmed in the Holston Valley area of Church Hill, Tennessee . The filmmakers purchased
440 acres (1.8 km2) along the Holston River for the farm set and planted corn. Most of the filming was
done along Goshen Valley Road and around the Goshen Valley Park area. Goshen Valley Road heads
south from  highway  11W in Church Hill, Tennes see. The cast and their families moved to the area a
month before the start of production to connect with the local people and learn farming skills. The floods
in the film were supplied by the Tennessee Valley Authority  and the Army Corps of Engineers  with water
from the Fort Patrick Henry Dam . The bank and downtown scenes were filmed in the town of Gate City,
Virginia . The tent city and a few other scenes were filmed in Kingsport, Tennessee , while some factory
scenes were filmed in Birmingham, Alabam a. Scenes that were filmed at Double Springs Baptist Church
in Jonesborough, Tennessee  did not make the final cut of the movie. The film was completed for under
$18 million.[3][4]
