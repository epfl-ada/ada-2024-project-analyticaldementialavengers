Colors  is a 1988 America n police procedural  action
crime film starring Sean Penn  and Robert Duvall , and
directed by Dennis Hopper. The film takes place in the
gang ridden neighborhoods of Los Angeles : late-1980s
South Central Los Angeles , Echo Park, Westlake  and
East Los Angeles . The film centers on Bob Hodges
(Duvall), an experienced Los Angeles Police
Department  C.R.A.S.H.  officer, and his rookie partner ,
Danny McGavin (Penn), who try to stop the gang
violence between the Bloods , the Crips , and Hispanic
street gangs. Colors  relaunche d Hopper  as a director
19 years after Easy Rider , and inspired discussion over
its depiction of gang life and gang violence.
Two policemen, "Uncle" Bob Hodges, a respected
LAPD  officer and Vietnam veteran , and rookie officer
Danny McGavin, have just been teamed together in the
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums
(CRASH) unit that patrols Northwest Los Angeles,
East Los Angeles  and South Los Angeles .
Hodges is appreciated on the local streets. He is
diplomatic on the surface, preaching "rapport" to gang
members to encourage them to offer help when it is
truly needed, recognizing that every action cops take is
scrutinized by the people they are trying to help.
Hodges explains his view on policing to his young
partner with a joke about bulls and cows. The 21st
Street Gang throw a rock at Hodges car and runs until
Felipe gets caught by Hodges. The Bloods have a
funeral for a deceased Robert Craig until the Crips
open fire at a church, Hodges and McGavin chases
after The Crips until their car flips over explodes
killing them.
At the 21st Street Gang hangout to walk away from the
gang life Ron Delaney tells the gang members to walk
away from the gang life, but they ignore his advice andPlotBudget $10 million

and drives her to his house to have sex in his bedroom.
Although the pair bond quickly , life lessons are
seemingly lost on the aggressive, cavalier McGavin, whose stunts soon bring him notoriety among the
gang mem bers and the people, such as attacking a graffiti artist by spraying his eyes with the paint can. A
drug dealer named T gives the drugs to the young kids before McGavin and Hodges arrives, McGavin
punches him in the face on the street before putting him inside the car, At the police station, Hodges gets
on McGavin about his wrongful actions against people. McGavin wrecks their first unmarked car during
a pursuit. Its replace ment is vivid yellow , resulting in McGavin being nicknamed "Pac-Man " by officers
and gang members alike.
McGavin has a short-lived romance with a waitress named Louisa who, like the offended Hodges, feels
the weight of the Pac-Man persona. Amidst the strain of these relationships, the murder of a Bloods  gang
member escalates tension between two other gangs. A series of seemingly random incidents culminates
with the two partners finding themselves in the middle of the Crips , Bloods and Hispanic barrio  war.
CRASH raids the house and arrest Oso, He tells the sherif f about the drug dealers including Hi Top,
Hodges and McGav in see Hi Top and He hops on a motorcycle,They chase after him and He crashes
through a restaurant  window and he gets caught by Hodges and McGavin. McGavin apologizes about his
wrongful actions to Hodges and talks about a new police partner . In jail, Hi Top gets beaten up by the jail
inmates and The sherif f questions him about the murder of Robert Craig.
Hodges,McGavin and the LAPD spot a dark blue van that used in the 187 murder of Robert Craig and
They arrest and question two black males about the van and Rocket's girlfriend.
The police were searching for Rocket (the leader of the Crips gang) in connec tion with the murder of a
Bloods gang memb er named Robert Craig. They raided the house of Rocke ts girlfriend and Officer
Baines killed a Crips gang member (Killa Bee), who they had mistaken for Rocket,as he reached for his
pants. The gang members mistakenly believe McGavin did the shooting and put a hit out on him. LAPD
questions Of ficer Baines over the shooting and killing of the gang member .
The 21st Street Gang, led by a criminal named Frog, attempts to negotiate a peace similar to Hodges and
steer clear of the melee. To protect his partner , Hodges unwittingly exposes Frog as his source on the
Crips leader Rocket's scheme to kill McGavin. The 21st Street Gang and Louisa are having a party at
their hous e, Rocket and The Crips do a drive by shooting on the gang, Hodg es, McGavin and LAPD
arrive at the scene after the shooting, McGavin encounters Louisa dressing after having sex with a 21st
Street gang member and she angrily confronts him by saying "look at me Pac-Man" but McGavin leaves
the room. The 21st Street Gang retaliates against Rocket and The Crips, They all get shot and killed. Each
group attempts to right the wrongs against their respective crews as police strive to prevent the hit and
stand their authority over the fall out.
In the end, CRASH moves in on the would-be last crew standing—the 21st Street Gang. While arresting
Frog, Hodges is fatally wounded by a 21st Street Gang gunman, nicknamed "Bird", trying to do the hit on
McGavin but shoots Hodges instead, CRASH shoots and kills Bird. With medics en route, McGavin
comforts Hodges and breaks down with regret as Hodges falls into delirium and dies.Sometime later, a more reserved McG avin has a rookie partner , a black cop who grew up in the
neighborhood where they patrol and sports an attitude like the "Pac-Man". McGavin tells him the same
joke about the bulls that Hodges taught him, and the younger officer reciprocates in the same way as the
young McGavin. The film ends with McGavin considering the cycle as the pair drive on and continue
their patrol.

The movie  was filmed entirely in Los Angeles in 1987. The original script by Richard Di Lello  took place
in Chicago  and was more about drug dealing than gang members. Dennis Hopper  ordered changes, so
Michael Schiffer was hired  and the setting was changed to Los Angeles and the focus of the story became
more about the world of gang members.[2][3]Cast
ProductionThe joke that Hodg es tells McGavin regarding the two bulls was lifted from the Pat Conroy  novel The
Great Santini (which was made into a movie  that also starred Duvall) and explains how the character Lt.
Col. "Bull" Meechum got his nickname.[4]
Real gang members were hired as "on-location security" as well as actors/extras by producer Robert H.
Solo. Two of them were shot during filming. Well-known gang leader and community activist T. Rodgers
was cast as Dr . Feelgood.[5]
On April 2, 1987, Sean Penn  was arrested for punching an extra on the set of this film who was taking
photos of him without permission. Penn was sentenced to 33 days in jail for this assault.
A soundtrack containing mainly hip hop music  was released on April 15, 1988, by Warner Bros. Records .
It peaked at 31 on the Billboar d 200 and was certified gold on July 12, 1988.
The theme song, "Colors", was written and performed by American rapper Ice-T , and issued as the title
track for the soundtrack to the film.
Colors  earned over $46 million in its domestic release.[6]
Colors  received both praise and criticism. The film has a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes  based on 39
reviews, with the consensus; "Colors  takes a hard-hitting yet nuanced look at urban gang violence, further
elevated by strong performances from a pair of well-matched leads."[7] Metacritic , which uses a weighted
average , assigned  the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "generally favorable"
reviews.[8]
Janet Maslin  of The New York Times stated that it "has a superb eye for the poisonous flowering of gang
culture amid ghetto life, and an ear to match; along with brilliant cinematography by Haskell Wexler , it's
also got a fierce, rollicking sense of motion."[9]
Roger Ebert  hailed it as "a special movie – not just a police thriller , but a movie that has researched gangs
and given some thought to what it wants to say about them."[10]
The Washington Post's critics, Desson Howe  and Hal Hinson  were split, with Howe stating that Hopper
"covers the mayhem with unadorned, documentary immediacy that transcends otherwise formulaic cop-
fare"[11] and Hinson stating that it "must be the least incendiary film about gang life ever made."[12]Soundtrack
Release
Box office
Critical receptionOne of the more negative reviews of the film appeared on the BBC 's Ceefax  service, on which critic
Louise Hart remarke d: "The main weak ness of the film is that it concentrates far less on the street gangs
than on the growing relationship between the two cops."[13]
The film has been blamed for inspiring gang violence in the country of Belize , with many members of the
Crips and Bloods deported to the country from the United States in the 1990s bringing the film - and their
own gang af filiations - with them to the country .[14]
