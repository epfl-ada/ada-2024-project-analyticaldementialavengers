Pieces (film)
Pieces  (Spanish : Mil gritos  tiene la noche , lit. 'The
Night Has 1,000 Screams') is a 1982 Spanish-
American slasher film direc ted by Juan Piquer Simón ,
written and produced by Dick Randall , and starring
Christopher Geor ge, Lynda Day Geor ge, Frank Braña,
Edmund Purdom , Paul L. Smith , Ian Sera, and Jack
Taylor .
The plot follows an unknown assailant  killing female
students at a college  campus in Boston , who uses their
body parts to make a human jigsaw puzzle. A co-
production of Spain and the United States, Pieces  was
originally released in Spain in August 1982, and was
distributed in the United States by Film Ventures
International .
Since its release, the film has attracted a cult following
and has been a drive-in  favorite. While not prosecuted
for obscenity , the film was seized and confiscated in
the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications
Act 1959  during the video nasty  controversy .
In 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts , 10-year -old Timmy
Reston is berated by his mother for playing with a
jigsaw puzzle  of a nude woman. After she orders him
to dispose of the puzzle, he returns with an axe,
murders her, then dismembers her body with a
hacksaw . When the police arrive, Timmy hides in a
closet and pretends to be a witness to the crime. The
police believe Timmy's story and he is sent to live with
his aunt. Forty years later, after witnessing a female
skateboarder smash into a mirror , a black-clad figure
opens a box containing a photograp h of Timmy's
mother and her bloodied dress. He also takes out the
bloodied jigsaw puzzle and starts to put it together .
A female student studying on the lawn of her Boston
university is decapitated  with a chainsaw by an
unidentified killer who steals her head. Lt. BrackenPlotFabio Frizzi[iv]

Box office $2 million (U.S.)[8]and his partner , Sgt. Holden, investiga te the murder .
Arthur Brown, a reserved professor of anatomy  who is
often teased by students for being homosexual, gives
the detectives a tour of the school, where the
groundskeeper , Willard, is seen trimmin g hedges with
a chainsaw . Student Kendall receives a note from a
female classmate to meet her at the pool for sex, but
the killer sends Kendall him a fake note to divert him
and then brutally murders the girl with a chainsaw .
Willard later arrives on the scene and is arrested as a
suspect after the police find a chainsaw by the victim's
body , missing her torso , at the pool. Professor Brown
inspects the remains, and is briefly considered a
suspect.
Dr. Jennin gs meets with Kendall at the station in hopes
that he can help provide a profile of the murderer .
Bracken brings in undercover officer and former tennis
pro Mary Riggs to pose as a tennis instructor at the
college, with Kendall's assistance. Reporter Sylvia Costa is stonewalled by Bracken. That evening, the
killer stalk s a student and saws her arms off inside an elevator just before Kendall and the police arrive,
then stabs Sylvia to death on a waterbed .
One of Mary's tenni s students, Suzie, is chased down in the locker room by the killer and sawed in half.
While Mary and Kendall focus on turning off blasting music the killer turned on as a diversion, the killer
escapes with Suzie's legs. Kendall theorizes that the killer is a faculty member , since he knows when and
where to strike while avoiding police. They discover that the dean changed his name and that his mother
was brutally murdered; the dean is Timmy .
Meanwhile, Mary is drugged with a paralytic  substance by the dean at his apartment. He attempts to saw
off her feet, since the previous victim 's feet did not fit in his mother's shoes. Bracken, Holden, and
Kendall burst into the dean's apartment, and he is shot dead by Bracken while Kendall rescues Mary .
After finding the jigsaw puzzle in the dean's apartment, Holden jokes to Kendall about joining the police
and leans on a bookshelf, which spins around to reveal the dean's human puzzle, a decomposing body
made of pieces of his victims stitched together in his mother's dress, which falls out onto Kendall. As the
shaken Kendall leaves with Holden, the jigsaw corpse inexplicably comes to life, grabbing and crushing
Kendall's genitalia  as he screams.

Film scholar Ian Conrich notes in Horr or Zone: The Cultural Experienc e of Contemporary Horr or
Cinema  that Pieces  has an "almost self-reflexive awarene ss of its status as an exploitation film".[9]
Conrich summarizes the film as a "hybrid amalgamation" of body horror  films, "the pioneering splatter
films  of Herschell Gordon Lewis ", and the Italian giallo .[10] Additiona lly, Conri ch criticizes the film for
having a "transpare ntly misogynistic narrative" as well as resembling the aesthetics of pornography ,
featuring scenarios similar to those found in contemporaneous adult films.[10]
The script for Pieces  was writt en by American exploitation filmmaker  Dick Rand all and Italia n producer
Roberto Loyola, credited as "John Shado w". Contrary to popular belief, Joe D'Amato  was not involved in
this production.[11] It was given to director Juan Piquer Simón  by Randa ll and Stephen Minasian, with
whom he had worked on previous films.[12]
Although the film was set in the United  States, specifically in Boston , it was mainly shot in and around
Valencia , Spain, home of director Simón,  though some exter ior filming took place in Boston.[13] The
shoot lasted four weeks with the cast and crew , and another week went by to film the special effects for
an estimated budget of $300,000.  Some of the American exteriors were shots reused from Supersonic
Man (1979), also directed by Simón.
According to the interview with Simón in Pieces of Juan  (on the Grindhouse DVD version of the film),
the directo r says that none of the female  stars of the film knew how to play tennis, even though they were
supposed to be portr aying "professional" players.  A tennis coach had to be hired so that they could learn
to lob the ball in a convincing enough manner to make the film believable.  Simón also reveale d in the
interview that he is proud of the visual effects in the film, especially that a pig carcass  was used for the
effect of the chainsaw cutting through a young woman's stomach and the slaughterhouse guts used.Analysis
ProductionThe film starred real-life husband and wife team Christopher Geor ge (of TV's The Rat Patrol) and Lynda
Day Geor ge (of TV's Mission: Impossible )).[14]
While the Spanish version had an original musical score by Librado Pastor , the international release used
library music from several composers (including Stelvio Cipriani  and Fabio Frizzi), collectively credited
as 'CAM'.
Pieces  was first released in Spain on August 23, 1982. It opened in the United States the following year in
Los Angeles  on October 14, 1983[15] through Film Ventures International .[3]
The film has gone on to receive numerous revival screenings since its original release, often as part of the
Grindhouse Film Festival.[16][17][18]
On the review aggregator  website Rotten Tomatoes , Pieces  holds a 46% approval rating based on 13
critic reviews, with an average rating  of 3.64/10.[19]
Kevin Thomas , film critic for the Los Angeles Times gave the film a nega tive review , writing, "Pieces  is a
wretched, stupid little picture whose sole purpose is the exploitation of extreme violence against women",
and furthe r criticized it for being poorly dubbed and lacking suspense.[15] Billy Kelley , enter tainment
writer for the Fort Lauder dale News , awarded the film no stars, describing Pieces  as a "gross-out
extravaganza" and a "bar gain basement abomination".[20]
In a retros pective review , Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club  wrote that the film's "narrative is pedes trian as
hell, but damn, the execution. The movie manages to luck into that ideal combination of over-the-top
bloodshed, gratuitous nudity (of both male and female types, though the latter is, as expected, the
mainstage show), and unintentional absurdity for which enthusiasts of the genre are perpetually on the
hunt".[21] Bill Gibron of PopMatters  wrote of the film: "Thanks to VHS and the thriving home video
market, the sleazoid shocker became an instant cult classic...  Pieces  is the kind of fright  film that sneaks
up on you. It is really nothing more than your standard slasher effort with a chainsaw doing all the slice
and dice (well, there are a couple of knife kills thrown in for good massacre measure)".[14]
Film schol ar Scott Aaron Stine was less laudatory of the film, writing that it blends elements of the giallo
and the slasher film "without adding anything new to either".[4] Scholar John Kenneth Muir  notes that the
film featur es sequen ces "so poorly staged" that they "elicit laughter", ultimately deeming the film "utterly
absurd from start to finish".[1]
The uncut, uncensored director's cut of Pieces  (a.k.a. Mil gritos tiene la noche ) appeared as a 2-disc DVD
in October 2008 distributed by Grindhouse Releasing  and Box Office Spectaculars .[12][14] The release
includes interviews with director Juan Piquer Simón and an extended interview  with star Paul L. Smith .
The two-disc deluxe edition by Grindhouse includes, for the first time, an (optional) restored originalRelease
Critical response
Home mediasoundtrack by Spanish composer Librado Pastor , as well as numerous other bonus materials.[12] In
September 2011, the British company Arrow Video released the film on DVD in a 1.66:1  anamorphic
aspect ratio version with an introduction by star Jack Taylor and a number of other extras.
Grindhouse released a double Blu-ray  edition of Pieces  in March 2016, which also featured  the
soundtrack on compact disc.[22] The Blu-ray discs include the U.S. theatrical and Spanish versions of the
film, a new documentary about the histo ry of 42nd Street called 42nd Street Memorie s, a re-scoring of the
film, a new comme ntary for the U.S. version by star Jack Taylor , and the extras from the 2008 special
edition DVD release. The CD includes the original soundtrack of the U.S. release of the film, a collection
of library music  licensed from CAM  (Creazioni Artistiche Musicali), taken from the origina l master
tapes.[23] In addition, the first 3,000 units of the special edition included a 15-piece facsimile of the nude
woman puzzle seen in the beginning of the film.[24] This 3,000-unit limited edition, known as the "Puzzle
Edition", was shipped out to customers early , and as of February 8, 2016, was sold out.[25]
