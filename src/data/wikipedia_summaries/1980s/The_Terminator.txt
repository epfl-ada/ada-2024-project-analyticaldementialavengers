The Terminator
The Terminator  is a 1984 Americ an science fiction
action film directed by James Cameron , written by
Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd  and produced by Hurd.
It stars Arnold Schwarzene gger as the Terminator , a
cybernetic  assassin sent back in time from 2029 to
1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Ham ilton), whose
unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction
by Skynet , a hostile artificial intelligence  in a post-
apocalyptic  future. Kyle Reese  (Michael Biehn ) is a
soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The
screenplay is credited to Cameron and Hurd, while co-
writer William Wisher Jr. received an "additional
dialogue" credit.
Cameron devised the premise of the film from a fever
dream he experienced during the release of his first
film, Piranha II: The Spawning  (1982), in Rome, and
developed the concept in collaboration  with Wisher .
He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World
Pictures  alumna Hurd on the condition that she would
produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd
eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion
Pictures , while executive producers John Daly  and
Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation  were
instrumental in setting up the film's financing and
production. Originally approached by Orion for the
role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title
character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which
took place  mostly at night on location in Los Angeles,
was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's
commitments to Conan the Destr oyer (1984), during
which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for
Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens  (1986).
The film's  special effects, which included miniatures
and stop-motion animation , were created by a team of
artists led by Stan Winston  and Gene Warren Jr .
Defying low pre-release expectations, The Terminator
topped the United States box office for two weeks,
eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest
$6.4 million budget. It is credited with launchingRunning time 107 minutes[1]

Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's
success led to a franchise  consisting of several sequels ,

games . In 2008, The Terminator  was selected by the
Library of Congress  for preservation in the United
States National Film Registry .
A cybor g is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 Los Angeles : an assassin dubbed "The Terminator ",
disguised as a human male and programmed to hunt and assassinate a wom an named Sarah Connor.
Separately , a human soldier named Kyle Reese  also arrives, intent on stopping the fiend, as they both
steal ammunition and clothing. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory , the Terminator
systematically dispatches similarly-named women before locating the actual Sarah at a local nightclub ,
but she is rescued by Reese. The duo then steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a
stolen police car .
As they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network
known as Skynet , created by Cyberd yne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global
nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah's future son, John , will rally the survivors and
lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the
resistance's victory , Skynet sends the Terminator back in time to eliminate Sarah, thereby preventing
John's birth. The Terminator is an efficient and relentless killing machine with a perfect voice-mimicking
ability and a durable metal endoskeleton  covered by living tissue to appear human.
The Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah down, but the duo lose it after a brief car chase. The police
apprehend Reese and Sarah and interrog ate Reese, but they disbelieve his story . The Terminator discovers
Sarah is inside the police station and attacks it, killing many officers while hunting for her. Reese and
Sarah escape, steal another car and take refuge in a motel , where they assemble several pipe bombs  and
plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in John's photograph and
that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they
have sex, conceiving John.
The Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother . She and Reese escape the
motel in a pickup truck while it pursu es them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly
wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator . She knoc ks the Terminator off its
motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator , now bloodied and badly
damaged, hijacks a tank truck  and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into
the truck's hose tube, causing the truck to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton. It
pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned  factory , where Reese activates machi nery to confuse it, but it
eventually discovers  them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection to blow it apart, but
at the cost of his life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a
hydraulic press  that she uses to destroy it.PlotArnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn (pictured in 1984, 1997, and 2008, respectively)
played the film's leads.Months later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through Mexico , recording  audio tapes to pass on
to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a polaroid  photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day
give to Reese, and she buys it. The gas station owner comments that a storm is coming and she replies
that she is aware, alluding to humanity's impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away towards
it.

who repor ts a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the
Terminator soon thereafter .
In Rome, Italy, during the release of Piranha II: The Spawning  (1982), director James Cameron  fell ill
and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.[6]
Inspired by director John Carpenter , who had made the slasher film Halloween  (1978) on a low budget,
Cameron used the dream as a "launching pad" to write a slasher -style film.[7] Cameron 's agent disliked
the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron
dismissed his agent.[8]
Cameron returned to Pomona, California , and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes,
where he wrote the draft for The Terminator .[9] Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction
films, the 1960s fantasy television serie s The Outer Limits , and contemporary films such as The Driver
(1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981).[10][11] To transla te the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill
Wisher , who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes invol ving Sarah Connor
and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by
phoning each other and recording phone calls of them reading new scenes.[8]
The initial  outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to
the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with
conventional weaponry .[12] Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid
Terminator ,[12][13] and shelved the idea until the appeara nce of the T-1000  character in Terminator 2:
Judgment Day  (1991).[14]
Gale Anne Hurd , who had worked at New World Pictures  as Roger
Corman 's assistant, showed interest in the project.[8] Cameron sold the
rights for The Terminator  to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she
would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to
the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron
stated that she "did no actual writing at all".[15][16] Cameron would later
regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar .[17] Cam eron and Hurd
had friend s who worked with Corman previously and who were working
at Orion Pictures . Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get
financial backing elsewhere. The scrip t was picked up by John Daly ,
chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation .[18] Daly and his
executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became
executive producers of the project.[19]
Cameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend
Lance Henriksen  show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the
Terminator .[18] Henriksen , wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face,Production

happening that the audience
likes, they don't care if it goes

shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impresse d by the screenplay and
Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[18] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from
HBO  and Orion.[18][20] The Terminator  was originally budgeted at $4 million  and later raised to $6.5
million.[21] Asid e from Hemda le, Pacific Western Productions , Euro Film Funding  and Cinema '84 have
been credited as production companies after the film's release.[4][3][22]
For the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who
also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy  had met Arnold Schwarzeneg ger and
sent his agent the script for The Terminator .[20] Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as
Reese as he felt he would need someone  even more famous to play the Terminator . Sylvester Stallone  and
Mel Gibson  both turned down the Terminator role.[23] Medavoy suggested O. J. Simpson  but Cameron
did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer .[24][25][26][27]
Cameron agreed to meet with Schwarze negger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a
fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.[28] Cameron was entertained by
Schwarzenegger , who would talk about how the villain should be played, and began sketching his face on
a notepad , asking Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still.[25][29] After the meeting, Cameron
returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that "he'd make a hell of a
Terminator".[30]
Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview
on the set of Conan the Destr oyer, an interviewer asked him about
a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for The
Terminator . Schwarzenegger responded, "Oh, some shit movie I'm
doing, take a couple weeks."[32] He recounted in his memoir , Total
Recall , that he was initia lly hesitant, but thought that playing a
robot in a contemp orary film would be a challenging change of
pace from Conan the Barbarian  and that the film was low-profile
enough that it would  not damage his career if it were unsuccessful.
In a later interview with GQ, he admitted that he and the studio
regarded it as just another B action movie , since "The year before
came out Exterminator , now it was the Terminator and what else is
gonna be next, type of thing". It was only when he saw 20 minutes
of the first edit did he realize that "this is really intense, this is wild,
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before" and realized
that "this could be bigger than we all think".[33] To prepar e for the
role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to
be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.[30]
Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than
100 words. Cameron said that "Somehow , even his accent
worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality , like they hadn't
gotten the voice thing quite worked out."[34]CastingVarious other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting .[35] Cam eron
met with Sting, but he was not intereste d as Cameron was too much an unknow n director at the time.[36]
Others who were considered for Reese , included Christopher Reeve , Matt Dillon , Kurt Russell , Treat
Williams , Tommy Lee Jones , Scott Glenn , Michael O'Keefe , and Bruce Springsteen .[37] Cameron chose
Michael Biehn. Bieh n, who had recently seen Taxi Driver  and had aspirations about acting alongs ide the
likes of Al Pacino , Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford , was originally skeptical, feeling the film was
silly.[38] After  meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind.[35] Hurd  stated that "almost everyone else
who came  in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this
human connection between Sarah Conno r and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot
of people came in and just could not pull it off."[39] To get into Reese's character , Biehn studied the Polish
resistance movement in World War II.[40]
In the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as "19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a
flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.
Her vulnerable quality masks a strength  even she doesn't know exists."[41] Lisa Langlois  was offered the
role but turned it down as she was already shooting The Slugger's Wife.[42] Jennifer Jason Leigh , Melissa
Sue Anderson , and Jessica Harper  were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor .[37] Cameron cast
Linda Ham ilton, who had just finished filming Childr en of the Corn .[43] Rosanna Arquette  and Lea
Thompson  also auditioned for the role.[44][45] Cameron found a role for Lance Henrik sen as Vukovich, as
Henriksen had been essential to finding  finances for the film.[46] For the special effects shots, Cameron
wanted Dick Smith , who had worked on The Godfather  and Taxi Driver . Smith did not take Cameron's
offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston .[47]
Filming for The Terminator  was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto , but was halted when producer Dino
De Laurentiis  applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine
months while he was filming Conan the Destr oyer. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted
to write the script for Rambo: First Blood Part II, refined the Terminator  script, and met with producers
David Giler  and Walter Hill  to discuss a sequel to Alien , which became Aliens , released in 1986.[46][48]
There was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the
addition of a canin e android for Rees e, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest
between Sarah and Reese, which Cam eron accepted.[49] To create the Terminator's look, Winston and
Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's
original drawing in Rome.[47][50] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a
Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces
were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproductions of Schwarzenegger's
face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster .[50]
The sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion  scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects
company headed by Gene Warren Jr.[51] A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film
involving the Terminator's endoskeleton. Cameron wanted to convince the audie nce that the model of the
structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of
Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate
Schwarzenegger .[52]FilmingOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT  Longslide  pistol modified by Ed
Reynolds from SureFire  to include a laser sight . Both non-function ing and functioning versions of the
prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers  were not available; because of the high
power requirement, the helium–neon laser  in the sight used an external power supply that
Schwarzenegger had to activate manually . Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was
promotional material for the film.[53]
In March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[50][54] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger
on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that "the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just
found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that
just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant."[55] Most of The Terminator 's action scenes
were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started,
Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which
Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped
every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[56]
Schwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line "I'll be back " changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the
word I'll. Cameron  refused to change the line to "I will be back", so Schwarzenegger worked to say the
line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career .[57]
After production finished on The Terminator , some post-production shots were needed.[58] These
included scenes showing the Terminato r outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a
body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.[24][54][58] The final scene where Sarah is
driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who
confronted them that they were making a UCLA  student film.[59]
The Terminator  soundtrack was composed and perform ed on synthesizer  by Brad Fiedel .[60] Fiedel was
with the Gorfaine/Sc hwartz Agency , where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working
on The Terminator  and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[61] Fiedel was invited to a screening of the
film with Cameron and Hurd.[61] Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had
only worked in television, not theatri cal films.[61] Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an
experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that "You know , I'm going to play this for him because it's
really dark and I think it's interesting for him." The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.[61]
Fiedel said his score reflected "a mechanical man and his heartbeat".[62] Almost all the music was
performed live.[8][62] The Terminator  them e is used in the opening credits and appears in various points,
such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.[63] It has been
described as "haunting", with a "deceptively simple" melody[64] recorded on a Prophet-10  synthesizer .[65]
It is in the unusual time signature  of 1 3
1 6, which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and
accidentally create d an incomplete loop on his sequencer ; Fiedel liked the "herky-jerky"MusicSchwarzenegger with President
Ronald Reagan two months before
The Terminator's premiere in 1984"propulsiveness".[65] Fiedel created musi c for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station  that
would be appropriate for a "heroic moment". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would
lose the audience's excitement.[62]
Orion Pictures did not have faith in The Terminator  performing
well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.[66]
At an early screenin g of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the
producers that the film should be screened for critics.[24] Orion
only held one press screening for the film.[66] The film premiered
on Octobe r 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator  played
at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at
the box office. The film remained at number one in its second
week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God!
You Devil.[67][68] Cam eron noted that The Terminator  was a hit
"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the
Christmas blockbus ters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small
pond than the other way around."[69] The Terminator  grossed
$38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in
other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.[5]
Contemporary critic al responses to The Terminator  were mixed.[4] Variety  praised the film, calling it a
"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances
and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegg er is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only
a few lines of dialo g."[70] Richard Corliss  of Time magazine  said that the film had "plenty of tech-noir
savvy to keep infide ls and action fans satisfied."[71] Time placed The Terminator  on its "10 Best" list for
1984.[66]
The Los Angeles Times called the film "a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with
fuel-injected chase scenes, clever specia l effects and a sly humor ."[66] The Milwaukee Journal  gave the
film three stars, calling it "the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien ".[72] A review in Orange
Coast  magazine stated that "the distinguishin g virtue of The Terminator  is its relentless tension. Right
from the start it's all action and violenc e with no time taken to set up the story  ... It's like a streamlined
Dirty Harry movie  – no expo sition at all; just guns, guns and more guns."[73] In the May 1985 issue of
Cinefantastique  it was referred to as a film that "manages to be both derivative and original at the same
time ... not since The Road Warrior  has the genre exhib ited so much exuber ant carnage" and "an example
of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after
commodity".[74] In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin  praised the film's script, special
effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.[74][75] Colin Greenland  reviewed The Terminator  forRelease
Critical r esponse
ContemporaryImagine  magazine, and stated that it was "a gripping sf horror movie". He continued, "Linda Hamilton is
admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger
is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cybor g."[76]
Other reviews criticized the film's violence and story-telling quality . Janet Maslin  of The New York Times
opined that the film was a "B-movie  with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality , and only the
obligatory mayhem becomes dull. Ther e is far too much of the latter , in the form of car chases, messy
shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way."[77] The
Pittsbur gh Press wrote a negative review , calling the film "just another of the films drenched in artsy
ugliness like Streets of Fire and Blade Runner ".[78] The Chicago Tribune  gave the film two stars, adding
that "at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style
actually helps, providing a little humor  just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too
hokey ."[79] The Newhouse News Service  called the film a "lurid, violent, pretentious piece of
claptrap".[80] Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film "repellent to the last degree", charging it with
"insidious Nazification " and having an "appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism , fashion and
fascination".[81]
In 1991, Richard Schickel  of Entertainment Weekly  reviewed the film, giving it an "A" rating, writing that
"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a
good little film". He called it "one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain
one of the best sci-fi films ever made."[82] In 1998, Halliwell's Film Guide  described The Terminator  as
"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures".[83] Film4  gave it five stars,
calling it the "sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold
Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining."[84] TV Guide  gave the film four stars,
referring to it as an "amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressiv e when one considers its
small budg et ... For our money , this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel."[85]
Empir e gave it five stars, calling it "as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular
character is in executing its targets."[86] The film database AllMovie  gave it five stars, saying that it
"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi- mythic narrative intrigue,
while turning Arnol d Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s."[87] Alan Jones awarded it
five stars out of five for Radio Times, writing that "maximum excitement is generated from the first frame
and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice
eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way."[88] Peter Bradshaw  of The Guardian awar ded it
five stars out of five, stating that "on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with
Carpenter and Spielber g. Sadly , it spawned a string of pointless and inferi or sequels, but the first
Terminator  [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement."[89]Retrospective
Post-r elease
Plagiarism and aftermathWriter Harlan Ellison stated that he "love d the movie, was just blown away by it,"[90] but believed that
the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of The Outer Limits  he had written, titled "Soldier ",
and threatened to sue for infringement.[91][92] Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed
amount of money and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film.[91] The credit was also
present on the 4k restoration  that receiv ed a cinematic release and was released on Blu-ray  in 2024 for the
film's 40th anniversary .[93] Some accounts of the settlement state that "Demon with a Glass Hand ",
another Outer Limits  episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the
film,[94][95][96][97] but Ellison explicitly stated that The Terminator  "was a ripoff" of "Soldier" rather than
of "Demon with a Glass Hand."[91]
Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would
have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he "had no choice but to
agree with the settlement. Of course, there was a gag order as well, so I couldn 't tell this story , but now I
frankly don't care. It's the truth."[98]
The psychoanalyst Darian Leader  sees The Terminator  as an example of how the cinema has dealt with
the concept of masculinity ; he writes:
We are shown time and again that to be a man requires more than to have the biological body of
a male: something else must be added to it... To be a man means to have a body  plus something
symbolic, something which is not ultimately human. Hence the frequent motif of the man
machine, from the Six Million Dollar Man  to the Terminator  or Robocop .[99]
The Terminator  also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance  and rebellion. The robots become
self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed.
The impact of this theme is so great that the Terminator robot has become the "prevalent visual
representation of AI risk".[100]
The Terminator  features a narrative where elements of the science fiction film and action film genres
prevail. While rarely considered a horror film, the film does feature iconography associated with the
slasher film, such as The Terminator as an unstoppable villain, and Sarah Connor as a final girl
archetype.[101]
Authors Paul Meehan in his book Tech-Noir: The Fusion of Science Fiction and Film Noir (2008) and
Emily E. Auger in Tech-Noir Film: A Theory of the Development of Popular Genr es (2011) found that
The Terminator  belonged to and was the originator of the term tech-noir . Both authors applied the term as
a film genre to several works from the 1980s to the 2000s.[102][103] Academic Carl Freedman  was critical
of Meehan's categorization, noting Meehan's lack of interest in genre theory  and that his handli ng of
generic categories of science fiction and film noir were  not clear .[104] Paweł Frelik also critiqued Auger'sThematic analysis
GenreMichael Biehn signing a
copy of the film during an
appearance at Midtown
Comics in 2012lack of knowledge in genre theory , and dismissed the notion of tech-noir being a unique film genre. Frelik
wrote that the films Auger mentioned including The Terminator  and Blade Runner (1982) had no
applicable reason to be understood as tech-noir rather than science fiction.[103]
The Terminator  was released on VHS  and Betamax  in 1985.[105] The film
performed well financially on its initial release. The Terminator  prem iered
at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video
cassette sales charts. In its second week , The Terminator  reached number
4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette
sales charts.[106][107] In March 1995, The Terminator  was released as a
letterboxed edition on Laserdisc .[108] The film premiered through Image
Entertainment  on DVD , on September 3, 1997.[67][109] IGN referred to

film library catalogue, MGM Home Entertainment  released a special
edition of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the

aggregator  website Rotten Tomatoes , with an average rating of 8.8/10. Its critical consensus reads: "With

In 2019, Huw Fullerton of Radio Times ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating
"The Terminator  was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in
1984, and no matter  how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact."[128] In 2021, Dalin Rowell
of /Film  ranked it the fourth  best film of Cameron's career , stating, "While its pacing and story structure
isn't as tight as its sequel's, The Terminator  remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever
created."[129] Phil Pirrello of Syfy  ranked it at number  seven in the "25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made",
stating, "Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger's career  with The Terminator , an
iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror  movie elements into one
of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron's well-structured script is pure polish,
with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today ."[130]
A soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and
rock songs used in the club scenes.[131] Shaun Hutson  wrote a novelization  of the film which was
