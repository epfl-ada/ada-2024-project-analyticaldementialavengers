Pink Cadillac (film)
Pink Cadillac  is a 1989 American action comedy film
directed by Buddy Van Horn , about a bounty hunter
and a group of white supremacists chasing after an
innocent woman who tries to outrun everyone in her
husband's prized pink Cadillac . The film stars Clint
Eastwood  and Bernadette Peters , and also has small
cameo appearances by Jim Carrey  and Bryan Adams .
Pink Cadillac  marks the third and final collaboration
between Eastwood and director Buddy Van Horn ,
following Any Which Way You Can and The Dead Pool
(which also features Carrey). It is Van Horn's final
film.
A white supremacist group is chasing Lou Ann, whose
husband, Roy, is a member . She has inadvertently
taken counterfeit money from them by running away
with his car (the pink Cadillac), which held the
supremacists' stash.
Tommy Nowak is a skip-tracer  whose speciality is
dressing up in disgu ises, such as a rodeo clown, to fool
whomever he is after. Tommy takes on the job of
finding Lou Ann because she skipped bail.
When he finally finds her in Reno, Nevada , Tommy
slowly becomes enamored. Roy and his gang kidnap
her baby , whom Lou Ann has left with her sister , so
Tommy decides to help Lou Ann get the baby back
instead of turning her in. While driving through the
West, seeking the baby , romance blossoms. They
eventually fight the white supremacists and retrieve the
baby .

The film received generally poor reviews. Caryn James wrote: "When it's time to look back on the
strange sweep of Clint Eastwood's career , from his ambitious direction of Bird to his coarse, classic Dirty
Harry  character , Pink Cadillac  will proba bly settle comfortably near the bottom of the list. It is the laziest
sort of action comedy , with lumbering chase scenes, a dull-witted script and the charmless pairing of Mr.
Eastwood and Bernadette Peters." ( New Y ork T imes, May 26, 1989.)
Hal Hinson praised the performers: Peters "...plays her comic scenes with a vivacious abandon..." She
"loosens him (Eastwood) up... and humanizes him. These two make a nifty comic team."[4]
Pink Cadillac  was released in May 1989, opening against Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . The film
eventually grossed $12,143,484. In contrast, the movie Eastwood made just prior to Pink Cadillac , the
fifth Dirty  Harry movie, The Dead Pool , grossed $37,903,295.[5] Perhaps due to the poor reviews and
meager box of fice, the film is, as of 2021, Eastwood's last action comedy .
It has a 24% rating  on Rotten Tomatoes  from 21 reviews.[6] It also went direct to video in the United
Kingdom, without a cinema release.
