The Phantom Stockman
The Phan tom Stock man is a 1953  Australia n Western
film written and directed by Lee Robinson  and starring
Chips Rafferty, Victoria Shaw, Max Osbi ston and Guy
Doleman .[2]
It was the first of several movies produced by Lee
Robinson in association with Chips Rafferty in the
1950s.
Kim Marsden inherits a cattle statio n near Alice
Springs after the death of her father . Kim becomes
convinced her father was murdered. She sends for a
legendary local bushman called the Sundowner , who
was one of her father's best friends.
Adopting the name Ted Simpson, the Sundowner
arrives at Kim's station with his Abor iginal offsider ,
Dancer . They are given work by the station manager ,
McLeod.
The Sundowner and Dancer discover that cattle rustlers
have been stealing stock. The realise the person behind
the murder is Kim's neighbour , Stapleton, who is in
league with the cattle rustlers and is romantically
interested in Kim.
The rustlers kidnap Sundowner but he uses telepathy to
get Dancer to come  to his rescue. Kim is united with
her true love, McLeod.[3]

Chips Rafferty and Lee Robinson had both failed to raise finance for individual  projects. Rafferty wanted
to make a £120,000  13-part series and film, The Green Opal , about immigration problems.[4] Robi nson
wanted to make a thriller , Satur day to Monday  which later became The Siege of Pinchgut . Both were
stymied by a gove rnment rule at the time which prohibited invent in non-essential industry over
£10,000.[5]
The two men knew each other because Robinson wrote scripts for Rafferty's radio show , Chips: the Story
of Outbac k. Both were frustrated at the lack of film production in Australia. They decided to team up
together and make a film that cost under £10,000, with Robinson directin g and Rafferty starring.
(Robinson had experienced directing documentaries and been an assistant on I Found Joe Barton .)
They were  joined by cinematographer George Heath and formed Platypus Prod uctions. Said Rafferty at
the time:
We nutted it out this way. What's the good of imitating English and American pictures when
we can get into places these foreign production units can't reach for sandflies and skeeters?
We'll pick locations and backgrounds the world knows nothing about. We'll study them for
dramatic values. But we're not buying stories. The stories will just come out of our heads and
still leave enough wood to make chairs.[1]
Robinson later elaborated:
We said, "Let's forget what the Austra lian public thinks about, what they might take to,
because if you put an Australian tag on a film it was the worst possible thing you could
do."... The thing was to try and go for different locales and different lines, new material but
fairly standard in the international approach... It was something that Les Norman (the
producer of Eureka Stockade ) said to us. "If you are working in a known background like
London or New York you can go for very different story lines, but if you are working in a
new background that is unfamiliar to your audience you have to be a bit conventional in your
story line because audiences find it difficult to accept a totally new background and a really
new story line at the same time." So I think there was a bit of that inherent in all of those
early films with Chips. [6]
It was decided to make the film in the Northern Territory where Robinson had worked for a number of
years.[7] The movie would focus around Chips Rafferty, playing a version of the character he portrayed
on radio.[8]DevelopmentThe film was originally known as Dewarra , Platypus[9] then The T ribesman .[10]
Charles Tingwell  was mean t to play a role but was unable to fit it in his schedule and was replaced by
Guy Doleman.
Seventeen-year -old Jeanette Elphick, 1952 model of the year, was cast in the lead.[11][12] Her voice would
be entirely dubbed by June Salter .[8]
It was shot around Alice Springs  in the Northern Territory  of Austra lia starting July 1952.[13][14] Several
days shooting were lost due to unexpect ed rain.[15] Inter iors – the girl's house – were shot in Sydney at a
small studio in North Sydney owned by Mervyn Murphy .[8]
Robinson later recalled:
My experience with actors was limited. Chips on the other hand had by now made quite a
number of films and he was an impeccab le technical actor .... There were people in the picture
of course who had never made a pictu re before. There weren’ t the opportunities here for
them to do so. He helped them a good deal by walking through scenes with them on his own
and getting things sorted out, timing their dialogue and so on. The other thing was that we
were working in actual locations. We decided right from the beginning we would never , ever
build sets. We were  working to a large extent in situations that were fairly genuine. The
Aboriginal involvem ent, the themes were genuine themes. I suppose, given my documentary
background and the fact that you are on actual locations and in many cases  using actual
people, it was inevitable that that would come through.[6]
The painter Albert Namatjira  appe ared as himself in the film. Lee Robinson had previously made a
documentary about Namitjira called Namatjira the Painter . This arguably made him the first Aust ralian
painter to cameo in an Australian feature.[16]
Robinson says that Geor ge Heath did not get along with Chips Raf ferty or Robinson.[8]
The Sun Herald  wrote that:
The film was made in a hurry , and looks like it; and the editing of many scenes is ludicrously
slow. Hopalong Cassidy  could probably clean up a dozen myster ies in the time it takes Chips
Rafferty to draw wisely upon a cigarett e. The romance is developed clumsily by script andCasting

Criticaldirection. There were some satisfactory punches on the jaw, and a little gunplay later on, but
generally there is not enough action to make the "dead heart" come to life.[17]
Rafferty and Robinson managed to sell the Pakistan, India, Burma and Ceylon rights for £1,000. While
filming The Desert Rats in Hollyw ood, Rafferty sold the American rights for $35,000, then the English
rights for £7,500.[1] (The movie would later screen on US TV as Return of the Plainsman .[18])
Robinson later claimed that the film recouped its costs within three months of being filmed.[6]
The film was distributed in Australia by Universal. The deal was done through Herc McIntyre  who had
supported a number of local films.[6] Robinson  says McIntyre gave the film a very advantageous financial
deal.[8]
In the United States it was released as Return of the Plainsman  whilst the working title was The
Sundowner .[19] In Britain the film was known as Cattle Station  or The T ribesman .[20]
Heath left the team and tried to get up his own film called The Jacker oo but was unsuccessful.[21]
Elphick later went to Hollywood and enjoyed a successful career under the name "V ictoria Shaw".[22]
