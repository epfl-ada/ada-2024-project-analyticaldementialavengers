Born Yesterday (1950 film)
Born Yesterday  is a 1950 Americ an comedy-drama
film directed by Geor ge Cukor , based on the 1946
stage play of the same name  by Garson Kanin . The
screenplay was credited to Albert Mannheimer .
According to Kanin's autobiography , Cukor did not
like Mannheimer's work, believing it lacked much of
the play's value, so he approached Kanin about
adapting a screenplay from his own play. Because of
legal entanglements , Kanin did not receive screen
credit.[2][3]
The film tells the story of an uneducated young
woman, Billie Dawn (played by Judy Holliday , in an
Oscar -winning performance ) and an uncouth, older ,
wealthy junkyard tycoon, Harry Brock (Broderick
Crawford ) who comes to Washington  to try to "buy" a
congressman . When Billie embarrasses him socially ,
Harry hires journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden ) to
educate her. In the process, Billie learns how corrupt
Harry is, and eventually falls in love with Paul.
The film was produced and released  by Columbia
Pictures . Kanin frequently stated that Harry Brock was
modeled on Columbia production chief Harry Cohn ,
with whom Kanin had a long and testy relationship.
According to Cohn biographer Bob Thomas , Cohn
knew of Kanin's attribution but didn't care about it. In
2012, Born Yesterday was deemed "culturally ,
historically , or aesthetically significant" by the United
States Library of Congress  and selected for
preservation in the National Film Registry .[4][5]
Bullying, uncouth junkyard tycoon Harry Brock goes
to Washington, D.C. with his brassy girlfriend, Emma
"Billie" Dawn, and his crooked lawyer , Jim Devery , to
"influence" a politician or two. As a legal precaution,
Devery presses Harry to marry Billie, as a wife cannot
be forced to testify against her husband . To hide andPlotBox office $4.15 million (US

still for Born Yesterdaysafeguard Harry’ s
assets from the
government, Devery
persuades Harry to sign over many of his assets to Billie, his reliably
docile and unquestionably obedient fiancée.
With aspirations to become a power broker among DC dignitaries, Harry
likes to exert domi nance over political figures he pays off, sometimes
humiliating them when they are not sufficiently compliant. Though his
own behav ior is much worse, Harry is embarrassed by Billie’ s oblivious
behavior with a prominent congressman’ s wife, disgusted with Billie's
ignorance and lack of manners, which he believes reflect badly on him.
When journalist Paul Verrall comes to interview him, Harry is impressed
by his unintimidated and spirited demeanor . Offering Paul a hefty fee as a
way of exerting dominance over a better -educated but underpaid member
of the Fourth Estate , Harry hires Paul to educate Billie and give her some culture.
Paul soon finds that Billie has a limited vocabulary and is completely uninterested in areas of common
knowledge outside of her sphere. Attracted to Paul, Billie suggests they have a fling, reassuring him that
Harry has always remained unaware because he doesn’ t pay attention to anything outside of his business
interests. Paul demurs politely but shows Billie respect and patience, using her attraction to him to
stimulate her interes t in world affairs. Starting with reading the daily newspape r, Paul encourages Billie
to circle items she doesn’ t understand. Initially Billie circles every article she attempts to read and
complains that she has to look up nearly every word. They discuss the related issues and vocabulary .
Blossoming under Paul's encouragement and her own hard work, Billie learns about literature, history ,
politics and the law , and turns out to be much smarter than she or anyone else knew .
Billie starts thinking for herself and applying her learning to her situation. She also falls in love with Paul,
who begins to appre ciate her intellectual development and reciprocate her feelings. When Billie begins to
read the documents that Harry has her sign for businesses under her name, she disapproves of a crooked
deal and refuses to sign. Harry reacts violently , striking her and forcing her to sign the contracts related to
his crooked deal. After consulting a dictionary during the heat of the argument, Billie calls him a
"fascist"; missing the mark, the increasingly out-of-his-depth Harry counters that he doesn't belong to any
organized religion. Tension grows in Billie’ s and Harry’ s relationship as he experiences her new
questioning and independence. Growing wary , Harry tries to intimidate her into signing his assets back to
him.
With Paul’ s help, gathering evidence against Harry in a safe place as a precaution, Billie uses her leverage
to escape from Harry's domination. She promises to give Harry back his property little by little as long as
he “behaves” in his business dealings and leaves them alone.
Later , when Paul and Billie are driving out of DC, they are stopped for speedi ng by a traffic policeman
who asks Paul for his “license,” Billie hands over their marriage license and the sympathetic officer lets
them go. When Billie comments that their marriage was "predestination," the officer says that he doesn't
know what that means, and Billie—the advocate for expanding vocabulary—responds, "Look it up."White House Sightseeing bus as pictured in

Though all the major Hollywood studio s wanted to film Garson Kanin's Broadway play Born Yesterday,
Columbia Studios purchased the rights for $750,000 plus a percentage of the profits in 1947, the second
most paid for screen rights to a play at the time behind the $1 million paid for Harvey .[6][7] How ever, the
project was put on the shelf for months because of casting problems. In April 1950, Columbia head Harry
Cohn assigned Geor ge Cukor to direct the film, though Cukor was not the studio's first choice.
Cukor's preparatory work for Born Yesterday was quite innovative. The actors rehea rsed the screenplay
for two weeks, then performed it before an audience drawn from studio employees. Cukor's idea was to
give the actors a chance to develop “dimensional characters,” and clock laugh values from audience
reaction before the cameras began rolling. Cukor held that if a scene is funny , there is no need to play
about with it. When people complained, “that laugh overrode the line, I did not hear the next line,”
Cukor's answer remained the same, “Go and see the movie again.” But he did make some changes –
when the laughter was long and loud, he added some visual detail.[8]Cast
Pre-production
CastingAccording to a Hollywood Reporte r news item, Hollid ay initially refused to reprise her popular
Broadway role for the film. In September 1947, Rita Hayw orth was reported to be in line for the role, but
in late April 1949, it was reported that Gloria Grahame  was to be borrowed from RKO for the lead, and
that Jean Arthur  and Lana Turner  had also been considered for the part. An October 16, 1947 Hollywood
Reporter news item stated that Columbia was negotiating with Paul Douglas  to reprise his Broadway role.
According to modern sources, Kanin convinced Cohn to cast Holliday by co-writing – with wife Ruth
Gordon  – a part specificall y for her in the 1949 MGM film Adam's Rib. Holliday's performance in the
film garnered her critical acclaim and convinced Cohn of her comedic abilities. Larry Oliver and Frank
Otto also reprised their Broadway roles. A September 20, 1950 article in the Los Angeles Daily News
reported that before filming began, the cast perfected their comic timing during six performances in front
of live audiences of studio employees.[9]
Although the film was clearly written for a mature audience, Kanin and Cukor were forced to amend the
film to appease censors. Cukor explained, "It seems ludicrous now, but twent y years ago you couldn't
have a character say, 'I love that broad,' you couldn't even say 'broad.' And the nonsense that went on to
get over the fact that Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford lived together! It required the greatest skill
and some new business that Garson invented, like Billie Dawn always creeping into the apartment the
back way . We managed to keep it amusing, I think, but it was so unnecessary ."
However , the censors thought the scrutiny was necessary , and Cukor was urged to use caution when
filming Holliday's dresses. At that time, it was mandatory for intimate body areas, especially breasts, to
be completely covered. The censors also requested that Cukor avoid any sugges tion that Billie was trying
to get Paul in bed. Billie's line "Are you one of those talkers, or would you be interested in a little
action?" was deemed offensive. However , Cukor stood his ground, and the line made it into the final
cut.[10]
In the stage production, Holliday's character Billie Dawn wore only five costumes, but in the film,
costume designer Jean Louis designed thirteen elaborate creations. Cukor asked Louis to “characterize”
the clothes, with obviously expensive and ornate clothes at the beginning, when Billie is dumb and self-
centered. However , as she acquires culture, her wardrobe becomes simpler and more elegant.[8]
To increase the film's authenticity , Cukor went to Washington, D.C. for locations, and the city became a
dramatic personage in the story . Six named Washington, D.C. locations (Jefferson Memorial , Library of
Congress , National Gallery of Art, Statler Hotel, United States Capitol  and the Watergate Steps ,[11] wher e
Dawn and Verrall attend a then-regular outdoor summer concert of the National Symphony Orchestra[12])
were included in the shoot. Observing tourists at the Lincoln Memorial , Cukor noticed that sightseersCensorship
Costumes
Locationswould chew gum and give works of art a cursory glance, if any at all. But in Hollywood movies,
sightseers invariably were shown standing in rapt attention. Avoiding these cliches, Cukor considered the
outdoor scenes among his best ef forts.[8]
The Hollywood premiere of Born Yester day was attended by many celebrities and the film was met with
enthusiastic applause. Jan Sterlin g and Paul Doug las, who had played the two leading roles on stage,
attended the premiere.[13]
In a review  publishe d the day after the film's premiere, Bosley Crowther  of The New York Times wrote,
"Just in time to make itself evident as one of the best pictures of this fading year is Columbia's trenchant
screen version of the stage play, 'Born Yesterday' ... On the strength of this one appearance, there is no
doubt that Miss Holliday will leap into popularity as a leading American movie star."[14][15] Variety
stated, "Columbia has a promising box-office offering in its screen version of the Broadway hit play,
'Born Yesterday .' The bright, biting come dy of the Garson Kanin legit piece adapts easily to film and there
is every indication that key-city audiences will give it a hearty ticket play."[16] Richard L. Coe of The
Washington Post called it "an even more beguiling comedy than it was on the stage, and Judy Holliday's
even funnier ... It's one of the few I'd like to see twice."[17] A review in Harrison's Reports  declared, "An
excellent adult comedy ... What really puts the picture over is the brilliant performance of Judy Holliday
as the beautiful but dizzy 'girl-friend' of an unscrupulous, uncouth multi-millionaire junk dealer , whose
downfall is brought about when he makes the mistake of deciding that she needs  an education. One has to
see and hear Miss Holliday to fully appreciate the superb delivery of her lines and the fine shadings of her
artful mannerisms."[18] The Monthly Film Bulletin  stated, "Garson Kanin's comedy is a pleasing lesson in
the virtues of democracy , enlivened by smart, sometimes witty , dialogue and by characterisation which, if
broad and simple, is always lively ."[19]
Syndicated Catholic  columnist William H. Mooring decried the film as "clever film satire strictly from
[Karl] Marx." In 1951, the film was picketed by the Anti-Communist Comm ittee of the Catholic War
Veterans because Holliday and Kanin were affiliated with organizations on the U.S. attorney general's list
of subversive groups.[9]
Supporters of the film included columnist Louella Parsons , reviewer William R. Weaver of the Motion
Picture Herald  and Kenneth Clark of the MPAA, who stated "we feel very deeply and sincerely the
picture gives warm th and positive support to the democratic ideals, principles and institutions of
America."[20]
In late 1950 many critics predicted that the Academy Award  for Best Actress would be given to Gloria
Swanson  for Sunset Boulevar d or Bette Davis  for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was
newcomer Judy Holliday for this film.[21] Bette Davis believed that her and Swanson's comparablePremier e

Awards and nominationscharacters effectively "cancelled each other out", allowing Holliday to win, a theory also invoked to
explain Marisa Tomei's  dark horse Best Supporting Actress win over Miranda Rich ardson and Vanessa
Redgrave for the 1992 Joe Pesci  vehicle, My Cousin Vinny.[22][23] Swanson recalled the press's reaction
following Holliday's win: "It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or
better still, a mad scene. More accurately , they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond."[24]

The British film magazine Pictur egoer  awarded the film its Seal of Merit, but warned its readers that
Holliday's character is "from New York's East Side, and speaks in a baby Bronx voice that is like the
tinkling of many tiny, tuneless cymbals. " The magazine admired Holliday's performance and spoke of her
in the same breath as Carole Lombard .

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Kanin reportedly pursued plans for an updated remake, possibly
starring Bette Midler , Barbra Streisand  or Whoopi Goldber g, as well as a musical version that might star
Bernadette Peters  or Dolly Parton , with Frank Sinatra  as Harry Brock, but neither of these projects came
to fruition .[32] The remake  was finally made in 1993, directed by Luis Mandoki and starring Melanie
Griffith, Don Johnson  and John Goodman .
In the " Stage 5 " episode of The Sopranos , J.T. (Tim Daly ) lies and cites this film as the
inspiration for the mob boss character in the film Cleaver .
Jimmy McGill  and Kim W exler  watch a scene from Born Yesterday  during the final scene of
"Plan and Execution ", the mid-season finale of Better Call Saul  season 6. The film is also
partially shown in the mid-season premiere " Point and Shoot ".
