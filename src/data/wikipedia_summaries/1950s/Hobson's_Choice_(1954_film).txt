Hobson's Choice (1954 film)
Hobson's Choice  is a 1954  British  romantic comedy
film direc ted by David Lean.[2][3] It is based on the
1916 play of the same name  by Harold Brighouse . It
stars Charles Laughton  in the role of Victorian
bootmaker Henry Hobson, John Mills  as timid  but
highly talented employee Will Mossop, and Brenda de
Banzie  as Hobson's eldest, fiercely determined
daughter . The film also features Prunella Scales  in one
of her first cinematic roles.
Hobson's Choice  won the British Academy Film
Award  for Best British Film 1954 .
Henry Horatio Hobson is the autocratic proprietor of a
moderately upmarket boot shop (boots, shoes and
clogs) in 1880 Salford . A widower , Hobson is a
notorious miser with three grown daughters: Maggie
and her younger and less-dedicated sisters, Alice and
Vicky. All three have kept house and worked in their
father's shop for years without wages, and Alice and
Vicky are eager to marry , and their intentions infect
Maggie. Alice has been seeing Albert Prosser , a young
up-and-coming solicitor, while Vicky prefers Freddy
Beenstock, the son of a corn merchant. Hobson has no
objection to losing Alice and Vicky, but Maggie is
another matter . He tells her she is too old for such
things, "...thirty and shelved." While mocking her to
his drinking cronies at The Moonrakers pub, he freely
admits that she is too useful to lose.
Insulted, Maggie decides to marry Willie Mossop, the
shop's gifted but under -appreciated bootmaker , despite
the timid man having no such aspirations. When Willie
informs her he has already been bullied into an
engagement to his landlady's daug hter, Maggie
promptly puts an end to that – to his great relief.
Maggie tells her father of her intentions and delivers
her terms . Hobson  attempts to intimidate WilliePlotCountry United Kingdom

Box office £206,579[1]instead, by threatening to "beat the love out" of him
with his belt. Willie declares he has no love for
Maggie, but if Hobson strikes him, he will stick to her
like glue. Hobson strikes him twice, and the couple
walk out.
Maggie seeks a loan of £100 from Mrs. Hepworth, a very satisfied customer . When Mrs. Hepworth asks
about security, Magg ie says that Willie is the security: he is the finest bootmaker  in Lancashire. With cash
in hand, Maggie finds a basement that will serve as both shop and living quarte rs, furnishes it, has Willie
buy tools and supplies, and arranges for the banns  to be read.
Hobson feels Maggie's absence. Alice and Vicky are unwilling or unable to pick up the slack, in the house
or the shop. The night before the wedding, Hobson storms off to The Moonrakers and gets drunk.
Stumbling home, he falls through a trapdoor into the basement of Beenstock & Co., where he is found
next day sleeping it off. Freddy Beenstock rushes to tell Maggie ... who gets an idea. When he awakes,
Hobson is served with a writ for trespass and damage.
Maggie's sisters reluctantly attend Willie and Maggie's wedding at the insistence of their fiancés. The
wedding dinner is held in the basemen t shop/home. Hobson arrives after dark to seek Maggie's advice
regarding his legal woes. She manoeuvr es him into negotiating with Albert Prosser , representing Freddy
Beenstock. Hobson reluctantly agrees to pay £500 to settle the matter out of court. Only then does he
realise he has been "diddled": the money will replace the marriage settlements  Hobs on refused to provide
for Alice and Vicky.
Willie dreads his wedding night, but all turns out well, and he emer ges a new man. The next morning,
they make their first sale: a pair of bootlaces for one penny . Between Maggie's business sense and Willie's
shoemaking genius, their business thrives. Within a year, they have not only paid off Mrs. Hepworth's
loan and 20% interest, they have also wooed away nearly all of Hobson's high-class clientele. Under
Maggie's tutelage, the meek and illiterate Willie is transforming into a confident man of business.
On New Year's Day, Hobson suffers hallucinations. Dr. MacFarlane diagnos es "chronic alcoholism."
Maggie summons Willie, Vicky and Alice to decide who will return home to look after their father . Both
Vicky and Alice adamantly refuse to do so. With no alternative, Hobson tries to get Maggie and Willie
back on the old terms, but Willie will not settle for anything less than a 50-50 partnership, his name first
on the sign, and Hobson relegated to silent partner . Hobson grudgingly accepts.
Willie wants to change Maggie's brass wedding ring for a gold one, but she insists on keeping it – to
remind them of their humble beginnings.

Robert Donat  was origi nally cast in the role of Will Mossop but had to pull out due to his asthma.[4] The
outdoor location scenes were filmed around the Salford area, with Peel Park serving as the courting place
for Maggi e Hobson and William Mosso p.[5] Interiors were shot at Shepperton Studios  near London  with
sets designed by the art director  Wilfred Shingleton .
Malcolm Arnold  took the comical main theme for the film from his opera The Danc ing Mast er.
Throughout the film, it is linked to Hobs on so often that he even whistles it at one point. Arnold wrote the
score for a small pit orchestra  of 22 players, and he enlisted the help of a Belgian cafe owner to play the
musical saw for one pivotal scene. After a night of drinking at The Moonraker , Hobson is seeing double,
and he fixates on the reflection of the moon in the puddles outside the pub. Arnold deploys the musical
saw to represent the willowy allure of the moon, as the clumsy Hobson stamps from puddle to puddle,
chasing its reflection.[6]
The film was one of the most popular at the British box office in 1954.[7] According to Kinematograph
Weekly  the film was a "money maker" at the British box of fice in 1954.[8]
In his New York Times review , Bosley Crowther  called Hobson's Choice  "a delightful and rewarding
British film", and praised the performances of the three leads and its producer/director .[9] TV Guide  gave
the film four stars, characterising it as "a fully developed comedy of human foibles and follies with
Laughton rendering  a masterful, sly performance, beautifully supported by de Banzie and Mills."[10] InProduction

The film won the Golden Bear  at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival  in 1954[12] and Britis h Film
