Cast
ProductionThe film's script was adapted by Wolfgang Staudte  from Arnold Zweig 's novel by the same name, which
the author wrote in 1943, while in exile in the British Mandate of Palestine . Director Falk Harnack,
whose own brother Arvid  was executed by the Nazi regime and who in December 1943 escaped from the
999th Penal Battalion  to fight with the Greek Resistance , decided to film Staudte's work in 1950.[1][2]
The Axe of Wandsbek  was view ed by 800,000 people in the first three weeks after its release,[3] and
received positive reviews.[2]
The East German political establishmen t and the Soviet representatives in the country disapproved of the
film, which they viewed as promotin g sympathy for the perpetrators of Nazi atrocities. The SED
politburo denounced it, proclaiming that "it did not present the proletariat resista nce as heroes, but rather ,
their executioners."[4] The film was banned after less than a month, although Zweig himself, who wielded
considerable influence as the President of the GDR's Academy of Arts, resisted the move.[5] Bertolt
Brecht  offered to write an alternate version, but was rejected.[6] The Axe of Wandsbek  was DEFA's first
film to be banned.[4] This happened soon after the governm ent established the DEFA commission to
regulate the studio and provide politica l control.[6] Shortly afterwards,  Harnack left for West Germany ,
abandoning his position as DEFA's artistic director . The studio came under the control of party
functionary Sepp Schwab.[7]
In 1962, the film was allowed to be screened again, in honor of Zweig's 75th birthday . The authorized
version was twenty minutes shorter than the original.[8]
