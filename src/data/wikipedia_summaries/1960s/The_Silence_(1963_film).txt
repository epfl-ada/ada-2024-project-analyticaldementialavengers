The Silence (1963 film)
The Silence  (Swedish: Tystnaden ) is a 1963 Swedish
drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman
and starring Ingrid Thulin  and Gunnel Lindblom . The
plot focuses on two sisters, the younger a sensuous
woman with a young son, the elder more intellectually
oriented and seriously ill, and their tense relationship
as they travel toward home through a fictional Central
European country on the brink of war .
The film is the third  in a series of them atically related
films, following Through a Glass Darkly  (1961) and
Winter Light  (1963), which is sometimes considered  a
trilogy . In addition to interpretations of spiritual issues,
The Silenc e is sometimes interpreted as presenting  its
two sister characters as two sides of a single woman,
one representing the physical and the other language.
Bergman was inspired by his travels around Europe
after World War II.
Against expectations of the filmmakers, it was a box-
office hit. The film was also noted for its frank
depiction of sexuality and won the award for Best Film
at the 1st Guldbagge Awards . It is regarded favorably
by modern critics. The film was selected as the
Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film  at
the 36th Academy Awards , but was not accepted as a
nominee
Two emot ionally estranged sisters, Ester and Anna, and
Anna's son, Johan, a boy of 10, are on a night train
journey back home. Ester , the older sister and a literary
translator , is seriously ill. Anna coldly assists her,
seemingly resentin g the burden. They decide to
interrupt the journey in the next town called "Timoka",
located in a fictional Central European  country on the
brink of war. Although Ester is a professional
translator , neither she nor her relatives speak the language of this country .PlotIngmar Bergman with Jörgen
Lindström, who played Johan, on
the set of The Silence.The sister s rent a two-room-apartment in a once-grandiose hotel. Ester suffers in her room, self-
medicating with vodka and cigarettes while trying to work. Johan soon begins wandering around the
hotel's hallways, encountering the elder ly hotel porter and a group of Spanish dwarfs who are part of a
traveling show. Meanwhile, Anna ventures into the city and is openly advanced upon by a waiter in a
cafe. Later , she watches a show in an uncrowded theatre, and is both repelled and fascinated when a
young couple begin to have sex in a seat nearby . Anna returns to the cafe, brushes past the waiter , and
returns to the hotel in time.
Left with Johan while his mother is out, Ester attempts to form a more intimate bond with him, but Johan
avoids her attempts to stroke his hair and face. On Anna's return, Ester is eager for an account of what her
sister has done after seeing her soiled dress. Provoked, Anna spitefully fabricates a sexual encounter with
the waiter to her sister . Anna also revea ls her intention to meet him again that evening, which Ester , not
wanting to be left alone, begs her not to do. Anna meets the man in their hotel, and Johan witnesses them
kissing and entering a room down an adjacent hall. Upon returning to the room , he asks Ester , why his
mother dislikes being with them, as she always departs as soon as she gets the chance. Ester tells him that
she has learned a few words of the local language, and she promises to write them down for him. Johan,
instinctively knowing Ester is seriously ill, embraces her in a show of concern and compassion.
After Johan has fallen asleep, Ester sobs at the door of Anna and her lover , asking to come in. Anna lets
her in and turns on the lights so that Ester can fully see the two of them in bed together . Anna tells Ester
that she once aspired  to be like her, mora lly elevated, but realized that her apparent goodness was actually
a reflection of Ester 's hatred of Anna and all that belonged to her. Ester insists that she loves her and that
Anna is wrong. Anna gets furious and asks her to leave the room. On leaving , Ester says "poor Anna",
enraging her even more. Anna's lover advances upon her again. Anna is laughing hysterically , but it turns
into sobs. The next morning, Anna announces that she and Johan are going  to leave the hotel after
breakfast. Ester deteriorates while they are gone, having painful spasms of suffocation. She is helped by
the elderly porter , who attempts to comfort her. She reveals her fear of death and loneliness but also her
loathing for sexual contact. When Johan returns to say good-bye, Ester gives him a note. After he and
Anna have boarded the train, Johan reads the title: "To Johan – words in a foreign language".
Uninterested, Anna opens the window and cools herself with the outside rain while Johan continues to
read the letter .

The Silence  is someti mes considered the third film in a trilogy that
includes Through a Glass Darkly  and Winter Light and focuses on
spiritual issues.[2] Bergman writes, "These three films deal with reduction. Through a Glass Darkly  –Cast
ThemesA fictional newspaper in The
Silence shows the constructed
language of Timoka, which
causes a lack of communication
between its people and the
protagonists.conquered certainty . Winter Light  – penetra ted certainty . The Silence  – God's silence – the negative
imprint. Therefore, they constitute a trilogy".[3] He later retracted his claim the films form a trilogy .[3]
After Bergman's death, filmmaker Woody Allen  theorized in The New York Times that Ester  and Anna
represent two conflicting sides of a single woman.[4] Engl ish Professor Leo Braudy  had earlie r made the
same argument, identifying Anna with the physical, as she is seen bathing and having sex. He saw Ester
as representing language, as she transl ates and writes, is repulsed by sex, has a poor body and only
masturbates. Braud y also referenced the possibility that Anna and Ester have an incestuous
relationship.[5] The character of Johan represents the one who perceives.[6]
While Bergman referred to the "Sile nce" of the title as "God's
silence," it can also refer to the lack of communication between the
protagonists and the people of Timoka. The sole understanding
between the characters is in shared appreciation for the music of
Johann Sebastian Bach .[7]
In a scene, Johan stares out of the window as a lone tank rolls down
the street at night. In Against Interpr etatio n, Susan Sontag  comments,
"Again, Ingmar Bergman may have meant the tank rumbling down
the street in The Silence  as a phallic symbol. But if he did, it was a
foolish thought". She then continues to say, "Those who reach for a
Freudian interpretation of the tank are only expressing their lack of
response to what is there on the screen".[8]
After World War II, director Ingmar Bergman  had visited numero us cities in other countries in Europe.
He based the design of The Silenc e on what he had seen in these travels,[5] in particular in Hambur g,
Germany in 1946, after it had been virtually destroyed by Allied bombing attacks .[9] He also recalled he
had been inspired by a visit to a hospita l, where he had witnessed an obese, elderly man being carried by
four nurses. "The image of him being carried away like a dummy stayed in my mind, although I didn't
really know exactly why ," he recalled.[10]
A throat infection distracted Bergman from developing a story idea for a fairy tale film abou t a princess
and devil, and during recovery he conceived the idea of travelers visiting a foreign city.[9] Initially , the
two main characters were supposed to be male.[11] He told Vilgot Sjöman  that he converted the characters
to female because "he was afraid that the part was too close to himself".[12] While Bergman said he was
previously shy about sex in film, he decided on a more explicit approach in this film out of a desire for
viewers "to feel, to sense my films".[13]Production
DevelopmentIngmar Bergman and Sven
Nykvist film on the set of The
Silence.Working titles of the film included Timoka ,[14] The City[9] and God's Silence .[5] According to Gado
Timoka  is Estonian  for "perta ining to the executioner".[9] Bergman developed the constructed languag e
spoken in Timoka.[15] Actually the Estonian word is timuka  meaning "executioner's".[16]
Bergman stated he "quietly" instructed Ingrid Thulin  and Gunnel
Lindblom  on the sexual scenes, and that they did not need much
convincing to participate in them. He viewed self-confidence as a
necessary asset for actors and actresses to have.[17]
The scenes in the streets and theatre were shot on a small budget.
Bergman acknowledged these sets could have been more elaborate
with more funding, but it may have worked to the story's
advantage.[18] Cinematographer Sven Nykvist  relied less on theatrical
lighting for his shots.[19]
The Silence  was submitted to the film rating/censorship board (Biografbyrån ) of Sweden in July 1963 and
went throu gh without any cuts. The general instructions for the work of the board had been modified just
weeks before the film reached them, and this contributed to its passage, though Bergman claimed that he
was not in any real sense trying to test the limits of what could be allowed in mainstream cinema. He
actually did not expect this rather inacc essible film, with sparse and uncommu nicative dialogue, to be a
big box-of fice success, and commented in an interview in 1970: "I said to Kenne Fant, CEO of the
Swedish Film Institute which had produ ced the film, 'You might as well realize, this isn't a film that will
have people storming the theaters.' Oh the irony; that's exactly what people did".[20]
The original cut, shown in Sweden and certain other countries, includes a number of brief but
controversial sex scenes, showing nudity , female masturbation, urination and a couple making out on the
seats of a murky cabaret theatre. This plus some strong language led to intense public controversy in
Sweden and several other countries at the time. In many countries the film was cut.[21][22][23]
According to Jerry Vermilye , The Silence  "achieved a measur e of sensationalistic attention by dint of its
scenes of sensuality , mild though they were. It raised a great deal of controversy in Sweden, and its
notoriety continued to raise hackles elsewhere in Europe. All of which attracted the attention of
filmgoers; in Britain and the United States it became a considerable hit, perhaps for reasons of prurience
rather than art".[24] Due to its reputation for "pornographic sequences" the film became a financial
success.[25]
Vermilye is supported by Daniel Ekeroth , who notes in his 2011 book Swedish Sensationsfilms: A
Clandestine History  of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema  that "Tystnaden  is the production, and marks
the exact moment,  when sex and nudity became normal in Swedish film. If an internationally
acknowledged director like Ingmar Bergman could portray sex in such an explicit way, the last border had
been cross ed. Horde s of less serious filmmakers immediately abandoned all remaining inhibition about
depicting whatever crazed and deprav ed ideas they thought would attract and scandalize a paying
audience".[26]Filming
ReleaseSwedish viewers attend the film's
initial release.
Ingrid Thulin, on the Silence set
with Bergman, received positive
reviews for her performance and
the Guldbagge Award for Best
Actress.In the United States , The Silenc e was distributed by Janus Film s, and after edits ran 10 minutes shorter
than the Swedish version.[18] The film opened in New York City on 3 February 1964 in two theatres, one
of which was known for featuring films with nudity .[27] On 19 August 2003, The Criterion Collection
released the film on DVD in Region 1, in a box-set with Bergman's films Through a Glass Darkly  and
Winter Light and Vilgot Sjöman's docume ntary Ingmar Bergman Makes a Movie .[28] In 2018, Criterion
announced a Blu-ray  release in Region A for 20 November 2018, along with 38 other Bergman films, in
the set Ingmar Ber gman's Cinema .[29]
During its initial release in Sweden, the film attracted 100,000
viewers per week.[30] The financial success of the film has been
described as "resounding".[11]
It was also a success in other territories.[30] Cynthia Grenier wrote
that in around 12 countries within months of the initial release,
people hoping to buy tickets were "lining up around the block"
outside of theatres.[31] In the United States, it grossed $350,000.[1]
The Monthly Film Bulletin 's review stated the film was too personal
to Bergman, excludi ng the audience, though the cast and a number of
scenes were excellent.[18] Bosley Crowther  wrote "Whether this
strange amalgam of various states of loneliness and lust articulates a
message may be questionable, but it does, at least, resolve into a
vaguely affecting experience that moves one like a vagrant
symphony". Crowth er also credited Ingrid Thulin, Gunnel Lindblom
and Jörgen Lindström  as "superbly tempered".[27] Richard Brody  of
The New Yorker  praised the film writing "Bergman unfolds grand
themes-childhood and its mute sensibility , adulthood and its unhealed
emotional wounds- in highly inflected images, which have an
anguished intensity unseen since the age of silent films."[32] Rose
Pelswick of the New York Journal-American  concurred the message
was hidden in "Obscurity" but Thulin and Lindblom were
"strong".[18] The film ranked 8th on Cahiers du Cinéma ’s Top 10 Films of the Year List  in 1964.[33]
The film has been classified as a "landmark of modernist cinema" with Alain Resnais ' Last Year at
Marienbad  (1961), Michelangelo Antonioni 's L'avventura  (1960), and Luis Buñuel 's Belle de Jour
(1967).[34] Popular film critic Vernon Young (critic)  reversed his position on Bergman and admitted in
1971 that The Silence  was an "extraordin ary achievement in its way...The Silence  rewards effort..."[25]
Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Mov ies list in 2008, writing  of "a tone of foreboding" and how
"there is no theology in The Silence - only a world bereft of it".[35]Reception
