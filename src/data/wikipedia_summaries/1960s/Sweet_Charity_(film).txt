Sweet Charity (film)
Sweet Charity  is a 1969 American musical  comedy-
drama  film directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse
in his film directorial debut.[2] It is adapted by Peter
Stone  from the 1966 stage musical of the same name  –
also directed and choreographed by Fosse – in turn
based on the 1957 Federico Fellini  film Nights of
Cabiria .
It stars Shirley MacLaine  in the title role, a taxi dance r
at a Times Square  dance-hall. The cast also features
John McMartin , Chita Rivera , Paula Kelly , Stubby
Kaye , Ricardo Montalbán , Sammy Davis Jr., and
Barbara Bouchet . Ben Vereen , in his film debut,
appears as a dancer .
The film was released by Universal Pictures  on April
1, 1969. It received a mixed critical reception, but
received three Academy Award  nominations - Best
Score , Best Art Direction  and Best Costume Design .
MacLaine was nominated for a Golden Globe Award
for her performance. Retrospective reviews have been
more positive.[3]
Charity Hope Valentine works as a taxi dancer  along
with her friends, Nickie and Helene. She longs for
love, but has bad luck with men, first seen when her
married boyfriend, Charlie, pushes her off Gapstow
Bridge  in Central Park and steals her life savings of
$427. The Fandango Ballroom and its sleazily erotic
setting are introduced by the song "Big Spender".
Charity shares her disappointment and hopes with her
co-workers Nickie and Helene in several scenes
throughout the film.
Somewhat later, Charity meets famous movie star
Vittorio Vitale, just as he breaks up with his girlfriend
Ursula. Charity goes to a nightclub, where the guests
perform the "Rich Man's Frug", and later has dinner
with Vittorio at his apartment. When Vittorio leaves thePlotEdited by Stuart Gilmore

be her good fortune  with the song "If They Could See
Me Now". Right after, however , Ursula comes back to
Vittorio, and Charity is forced to spend a humiliating
night in a closet while Vittorio and Ursula make love
and sleep together . Charity again returns to the
Fandango, where she, Nickie, and Helene commiserate
on the building's rooftop with "There's Got to Be
Something Better Than This".
Looking for a more respectable and rewarding line of
work, Charity goes to an employment agency , but she
is forced to admit that she has no higher education or
qualifications, and the interviewer think s she has been
sent in as a joke. She agrees that she has and leaves.
The building's elevator breaks down between floors and Charity supports a man who starts to panic. This
is the shy and claustrophobic Oscar Lindquist, who pursues Charity onto the street and finally asks her to
go on a date with him. The two go out together several times, including a visit to an alternative church
presided over by a preacher named Big Daddy and "worshiping" with the song "The Rhythm of Life".
Charity does not tell Oscar what her job is and lets him think she works in a bank. Oscar proposes
marriage and professes to be broadminded when she does finally tell him her trade. Charity's hopes are
once again  lifted, celebrated in the huge production number "I'm a Brass Band". Oscar meets Charity's
friends at the Fandango when they throw a party for her. However at the marriage license bureau Oscar
tells her that he has tried to accept her past but is unable to go through with the marriage.
Charity returns to the bridge in Central Park where she first appeared in the film and seems ready to
throw herself off it, but a passing group of young hippies  singing about love and peace hand her a flower ,
lifting her spirits.
An alternate ending, included on the Laserdisc, DVD and Blu-ray releases, picks up after Oscar leaves
Charity . Oscar starts to go crazy in his apartment and, feeling suffocated, goes for a walk in the park. He
sees Charity on their bridge in Central Park and thinks she is going to jump. Racing to rescue her, he trips
and falls in the water . Charity jumps in after him, but can't swim so Oscar rescues her. Oscar realizes
Charity is the only breath of fresh air in his life, proposes again, and she accepts. Fosse thought the
ending was too corny , but filmed it anticipating that the studio would demand a happy ending. In the end,
they agreed with Fosse and kept the original ending from the stage version.

Shirley MacLaine, a friend of Fosse and his wife and partner Gwen Verdon , had suggested the adaptation
to Lew Wasserman , the head of Universal Pictures . Verdon, who had starred as Charity in Fosse's original
Broadway musical, had wanted to play the lead again but endorsed MacLaine to star in the film since she
was a recognizable movie star. Verdon did contribute to the film, without credit, as the assistant
choreographer . Chita Rivera  and Paula Kelly , who had appeared in a London stage production of the play,
have supporting roles in the film. John McMartin  was the only lead actor from the Broadway version to
reprise his role.[9]
During production, Fosse had conflicts with his original producer , Ross Hunter , who was replaced by
Robert Arthur. I.A.L. Diamond , who had written the screenplays for The Apartment  and Irma la Douce ,
both starri ng MacLaine and co-written and directed by Billy Wilder, was origi nally hired as screenwriter ,
but he too quit after disagreements with Fosse and was replaced by Peter Stone .[2] According to the AFI
Catalog of Featur e Films , Diamond wanted to revert to the “original theme” of Nights of Cabiria  (e.g.
prostitution ).[2]
Shelley Graham, soon to be known as adult film actress Geor gina Spelvin , was an uncredited dancer in
the film[5][6] She doubled  for Shirley MacLaine in a handful of scenes.[5][6]Charts
ProductionFilming took place on-location in New York City , and at the Universal Studios Lot .[2]
Critical reception of the film at release was mixed. While some praised Fosse's  innovative approaches to
the staging of some numbers and Shirley MacLaine's performance, others found it overlong, most of the
songs ineffective, and the storyline insufficiently engaging. Reviewers famili ar with the stage version
were especially critical. Vincent Canby  in the New York Times was especially harsh, disparaging the film
as "so enlarged and so inflated that it has become another maximal movie: a long, noisy and, finally , dim
imitation of its source material," and complaining that although MacLaine "often looks like Miss Verdon,
she never succeeds in re-creating the eccentric line that gave cohesion to the original".[10]
The film has been reappraised over the years and has been reviewed positively . Sweet Charity has an 82%
"Fresh" rating on review aggregation  site Rotten Tomatoes  based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of
6.40/10.[3]
The actua l cost of the film's productio n has been disputed, amidst conflictin g accounts by Universal
Pictures, reports in Variety , and claims by Fosse himself, but estimates range from $8 million to more
than $20 million. Regardless of the actual cost, the film's returns were a huge disappointment for the
studio. By January 1970, the film had made only $1.1 million, just a bit more  than the cost of Shirley
MacLaine's salary .[2] By 1976, according to Variety , the film earned rentals of $4,025,000 in the US and
Canada.[11]
The film was screened at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival , but outside of the main competition.[12]Reception

Sweet Charity  and its making are briefly alluded to under a different title in Fosse's autob iographical
musical film All That Jazz (1979). Additionally , the film's failure marks the first episode of Fosse/V erdon,
the 2019 biographical mini-series abou t Fosse and Gwen Verdon, their rocky marriage, and their long
creative partnership.
Sweet Charity , particularly the "Rich Man's Frug" musical number , has served as a visual reference for
dance sequences in contemporary popul ar culture. Several music videos have paid tribute to that number ,
including the videos for Emma Bunton 's 2003 "Maybe ",[15] Beyoncé 's 2007 "Get Me Bodied "[16] and
2008 "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)",[17] and Ariana Grande 's 2014 "Problem ".[18] The viral dance
that Jenna Ortega  performed in the November 23, 2022 episode of Wednesday , and choreographed, was
partially inspired by "Rich Man's Frug" as well.[19]
