Jigoku (film)
Jigoku  (地獄, "Hell"), also titled The Sinners of Hell,
is a 1960 Japanese horror  film directed by Nobuo
Nakagawa  and produced by Shintoho . The film stars
Utako Mitsuya  and Shigeru Amachi , and is notable for
separating itself from other Japanese horror films of
the era such as Kwaidan  or Onibaba  due to its graphic
imagery of torment in Hell.[3] It has gained a cult film
status. Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last
production being Jigoku .[4]
A student, Shirō, is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko,
the daugh ter of his professor , Mr. Yajima. After
announcing the engagement, Shirō's colleague Tamura
drives Shirō home. Taking a side street at Shirō's
request, Tamura hits and kills yakuza  gang leader ,
Kyōichi. Though Shirō wants to stop, Tamura keeps
driving , feels no guilt and says that it is Shirō's fault
for asking him to drive down that street. Kyōichi's
mother , who witnessed the incident, resolves to find
and kill them.
Though Tamura feels no guilt for the murder , Shirō
does and attempts to go to the police . After telling
Yukiko of what happened, Shirō insists that they take a
taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to
walk inste ad. The vehicle crashes, killin g Yukiko. After
Yukiko's funeral, Shirō meets strip bar worker and
Kyōichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko, who discovers
Shirō's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping
with him and, with Kyōichi's mother , plots revenge.
Shirō learns that his mother , Ito- who lives in a
retirement community run by his father , Gōzō- is dying. Shirō arrives there and meets the other residents
of the community , including a painter , Ensai, who is wanted for a crime in another city and is painting a
portrait of Hell; a former reporter , Akagawa; a corrupt detective, Hariya; the community doctor , Dr.
Kasuma; and Sachiko, a nurse and Ensai's daughter , who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko. While
Ito lies dying, Gōzō  carries on an open affair with a mistress . Later, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima arrive by train.
Ito dies, and Ensai (who was Ito's lover years prior to Ito and Gōzō's marriag e) lambasts Gōzō for his
activities with his mistress. Tamura appears and reveals that each resident has some complicity in aPlotmurder: Mr. Yajima caused the death of a fellow soldier during a war; both Hariya and Akagawa framed
or slandered innocent men who then both died by suicide; and Dr. Kasuma know ingly misdiagnosed Ito's
condition.
Yoko tracks Shirō down and meets with him on a rope bridge. She reveals her identity and attempts to
shoot him, but trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and after a struggle, Tamura also falls into the
gorge. Shirō returns in time for the community's tenth anniversary party , where Gōzō has allowed cheap,
rancid fish to be served to the residents.  As the partiers descend into insobriety , Mr. and Mrs. Yajima kill
themselves by leaping in front of a train, and Gōzō's mistress falls to her death  after an altercation. The
residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Kyōichi's mother poisons the remaining residents'
wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko. Enraged, Shiro
strangles Tamura to death while Kyoichi's mother does the same to him.
In Limbo , Shirō encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with their child when she died.
Having sent the baby girl, whom she names Harumi, floating away on the Sanzu River , Yukiko begs
Shirō to save the child. Shirō enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment by Lord Enma  for his sins.
While searching for his daughter in Hell, Shirō witnesses those from his life suffering for their
wrongdoings—being boiled and burned, flayed, or dismembered and beaten by oni, only to be revived to
suffer anew . Tamura taunts Shirō, saying there is no escape from Hell, before Tamura himself is tortured
for his misdeeds. Shirō finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Ito, who reveals that Sachiko is
his sister: Shirō is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually Ito's daughter . While caught in a vortex of
damned souls, Shirō finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on a large wheel. Lord Enma gives Shirō
one chance to save his daughter , otherwise she too will suffer eternally . As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his
mother call to him, Shirō leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter .
In the realm of the living, everyone at the party is dead, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after
completing his portrait of Hell and setting it on fire. Elsewhere, both Sachiko and Yukiko are seen
standing and smiling, calling to Shirō as sister and lover , respectively , with lotus petals falling around
them, implying that Shirō has success in saving his daughter , enabling the souls Sachiko, Yukiko and
Shirō to be purified to go to Heaven.

Nobuo Nakagawa  asked Ichirō Miyagawa  to write the script, which was originally supposed to be called
Heaven and Hell, under order of producer  Mitsugu Okura .[5] Mitsugu Okura read the script  and angrily
said to Miyagawa that "Heaven is nowhere to be seen in this script!", to which Miyagawa jokingly replied
that he would write about Heaven in the sequel.[5] Actor Yoichi Numata  played Tamura in the film, and
expressed that he had tried to analyze the role, but couldn't find the best way to play it.[6]
The film was not expected to be well received, as Shintoho  studio  was considered to be a maker of low-
budget, gory films.  Jigoku  was made in a hurry , and was the last Shintoho production. For the scenes
which take place in hell, the cast and crew used Shintoho's largest soundstage and put dirt over it.[7] In a
recent documentary , a crew member said that normally it would be just the crew  helping to build the sets,
but because it was Shintoho's last production, all the extras  were  helping.[8] Mamoru Morita  said that
Nobuo Nakagawa tried in many ways to make Jigoku  different from other horror  films from the time.[7]
Jigoku  was theatrically released in Japan on July 30, 1960.[1]
The film was released on DVD  in North America from the Criterion Collection  on September 19, 2006.[9]Production

Reception
Retrospective receptionRetrospective reviews of the film have been more positive, with many critics now recognizing it as a
cornerstone for Nakagawa’ s career . Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews  awarded the film
a grade "A", calling it "[a] disquieting morality tale based upon the Buddhist  concept of an afterlife".
Schwartz praised the film's performance s, and visuals which he felt 'acted as a lurid study of sin without
salvation'.[10] In an essay for the Criterion Collection , Chuck Stephens wrote, "Overflowing with brackish
ponds of bubbling pus, brain-rattling disjunctions of sound and image, and at times almost dauntingly
incomprehensible plot twists and eye-as saulting bouts of brutish montage, Jigoku  is more than merely a
boundary-pummeling classic of the horror genre—it’ s as lurid a study of sin without salvation as the
silver screen has ever seen."[11] Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horr or! praised the film, calling it "a
masterpiece in visual and abstract horror". Gallman praised the film's performances, eerie score,
Nakagawa’ s directio n, and "vivid color palette".[12] Horr orNews.net  stated in their review  of the film that,
"Although this film contains effects that are outdated by modern standards, it is a very powerful story that
is based upon the Buddhist belief that sins are atoned for in the afterlife."[13]
Jigoku  has developed a cult following  over the years and is now considered a cult classic.[10][14]
In 1979, the acclaimed Nikkatsu  Roman Porno director Tatsumi Kumashiro  remade Jigoku  for Toei.[15]
