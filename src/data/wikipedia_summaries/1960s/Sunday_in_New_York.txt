Sunday in New York
Sunday in New York is a 1963 American romantic
comedy  film directed by Peter Tewksbury  from a
screenplay by Norman Krasna , based on Krasna's 1961
play of the same name . Filmed in Metrocolor , the film
stars Cliff Robertson , Jane Fonda , and Rod Taylor,
with Robert Culp , Jo Morrow , and Jim Backus . The
score was composed and recorded by Peter Nero , who
also appears as himself performing in a nightclub; Mel
Tormé  sang the title song.
Eileen Tyler, a 22-year -old music critic for the Albany
Times Union , is suffering from her breakup with Russ
Wilson, a handsome, athletic, and thoroughly self-
absorbed scion of Albany 's richest family . Seeking
advice on the premarital sex she has refused him, she
appears unannounced at the chic Upper East Side loft
apartment of her elder brother Adam, an airline pilot.
Eileen confides to him that she thinks she may be the
only 22-year -old virgin left in the world. Adam assures
her that men want women who preserve their virtue,
and, at her insistenc e, swears he has not slept around.
An anxiously anticipated rendezvous  with his
occasional girlfriend  Mona Harris, scutt led by Eileen's
arrival, lets the audience know otherwise.
Shut out of his own apartment, Adam gamely tries to
find a place for a tryst with Mona, ginning a cover
story for Eileen that the pair are going skating at
Rockefeller Center . Some time after their departure,
Adam's boss rings up, desperate to locate an "on-call"
pilot. Anxious to deliver the message to her brother ,
Eileen heads for the skating rink, only to begin a series
of misadv entures with a visiting Philadelphia  music
critic, Mike Mitchell.
These eventually lead the pair back to Adam's
apartment to dry out rain-soaked clothes together .

bewildered but ultimately game Mike—until he
discovers she is a virgin. Invoking an unspoken code
of honor among sexually active males, he refuses to
take hers, much to Eileen's disorientation and
annoyance. After cooling off, the bumptious and still
semi-clad pair begin to calmly talk things through,
only to be ambushed by the unannounce d arrival of an
obnoxiously giddy and hellfire marriage-bent Russ.
Desperate to avoid being incriminated for something
worse than had actually occurred, the pair pretends Mike is Adam, a ruse that comes off smoothly until
Adam himself appears in his own doorway .
A modest farce devolves into a broad one, with an irritated Adam only scarcely willing to play his
unwelcome part. Socked by him for even having tried to make love to his sister , Mike attempts an orderly
retreat to Philadelphia while the ruse still holds, only to end up socked later outside the apartment by
Russ after Eileen tried and failed to make a clean breast of things with her by-then fiance. Adam catches
Mona on the telephone; he proposes and she says yes.
Soaked again, and with Adam apparently called away to fly, Mike ends up seeking dry refuge in Adam's
apartment—once more, initially all on the up-and-up. He and Eileen retire separately . After believing he
has locked her in the bedroom and literally thrown the key out the window , Mike confesses his love
through the door. Met with dead silence, he retreats downstairs, only to have Eileen, who had meanwhile
innocently slipped there, run into his arms.
A voiceover reveals Eileen ended up married and living happily in Tokyo  with Mike, bearing the adoring
couple three lovely daughters.

The play was seen on Broadway by Eliot Hyman  and Ray Stark of Seven Arts Productions  who "thought
it would make a good movie", according to Stark.[4] Other companies were interested in film rights, but
Stark called Krasna direct in Switzerland and did the deal. According to one account, the rights cost
$150,000 plus a percentage of the gross.[5] Another account claims the price was $200,000.[6]Cast
ProductionThe film was a part of a multi-picture deal between Seven Arts and MGM . Lead roles originally were
offered to Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty , who turned them down. Peter Tewksbury , better known for
his work in televisio n, signed to direct.[1] Robert Redford  auditioned to repris e his stage role but said his
reading "did not go well" and he was not cast.[7]
Jane Fonda  agreed to star in the film for a fee of $100,000 (equivalent to $995,000 in 2023).[8] She later
described her character as "an absolute bore", adding, "She talks so much about her virginity; and you
know the more she talks about it, the more it's on her mind. I mean, for God's sake, let her make her mind
up one way or the other—and stop all that talking."[9]
Filming started 21 April[10] and took place in the spring of 1963 on location in New York and on the
MGM backlot in Los Angeles,[1] with Adam's address given as 120 E. 65th Street.[11] Rod Taylor  later
said he and Fonda "got on like a couple of lovely kids",[12] adding the film "seemed like a labor of love to
her... [it] was a wonderful, frothy time."[13]
In a review of the playwright's "frank screen version" of the play, Bosley Crowther  characterized the film
as another  in a series of films that dwelled on a subject first brought to the screen ten years earlier in The
Moon Is Blue: "There once was a time when the candor of Mr. Krasna's mildly popular Broadway play
about an Albany girl who struggles bravely with the problem of her virtue during a rainy afternoon in
New York might have caused the Production Code  peop le a moment or two of anxious pause. They might
then have thought it a bit too racy for youthful and innocent ears".[14] On the film itself, Crowther said
"the extent of the film's disconcertion and delight for a viewer will depend upon  how prone one may be to
a juvenile quandary and to the nimble performing of a pleasant cast. The twists of the plot are downright
hackneyed—the confusions of opening the wrong doors, mistaking people  and getting caught in
dishabille . But the actors are all attractive, and so long as one can go along with them in their valiant
attempts at pretending this is hot stuf f, one may have a good time."
Variety  called it "a cut above the average of its lightweight class."[15]
According to Time magazine, "Sunday in New York is another brightly salacious Hollywo od comedy
about the way of a man with a maid who just may. 'This motion picture,' leers an announcement flashed
on the screen as a teaser , 'is dedicated to the proposition that every girl gets...sooner or later.' As usual,
winking wickedness  turns out to be mostly eyewash, but the plot—more to be pitied than censored—gets
a buoyant lift from stars Jane Fonda, Cliff Robertson and Rod Taylor . All three abandon themselves to the
film version of Norm an Krasna's trite Broadway farce with disarming faith, as though one more glossy ,
glittering package of pseudo sex might save the world."[16]
In 2019, when asked if she disliked any of her films, Fonda commented that she was "surprised how
many people say they love Sunday in New Y ork. Why?"[17]Reception

Box officeThe film broke even for the studio in North America by earning $2 million in distributor rentals .[1]
