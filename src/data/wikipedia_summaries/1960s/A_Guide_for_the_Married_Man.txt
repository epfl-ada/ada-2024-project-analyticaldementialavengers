According to Fox records, A Guide for the Married Man needed to earn $5,900,000 in rentals to break
even, and it returned $7,355,000, resulting in a profit.[7]
In a contem porary review for The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther  called A Guide for the Married
Man "the broadest and funniest farce to come out of Hollywood since the Russians  came last year", and
wrote:
What is thoroughly  disarming and delightful about this mischievous film is the impudent
candor of it and its freedom from the leer. Mr. Matthau approaches infidelity with the
ingenuousness of a clumsy bull moose , and Mr. Morse assists his intentions with all the
wickedness of an imp. The felicities of girl-watching—and there are many of them through
the film—are treated with absolute frankness as innocent enjoyment. And Mr. Kelly has
directed with speed and persistent wit. "A Guide for the Married Man'' is in the spirit of some
of those wonderful old Robert Benchley  shorts.[8]
Variety  wrote, "Walter Matthau plays a married innocent, eager to stray under the tutelage of friend and
neighbor Robert Morse. But this long-married hubby is so retarded in his Immorality (it takes him 12
years to get the seven-year -itch) that, between his natural reluctance and mentor Morse's suggestions
(interlarded with warnings against hastiness), he needs the entire film to have his mind made up."[9]
Critic Roger Ebert  of the Chicago Sun-T imes wrote, "There are a lot of funny people in this movie, but
they are not very funny people in this movie, Gertrude Stein  might have said. The Casino Royale
syndrome has struck again in A Guide for the Married Man, and we are forced to sit and watch as dozens
of big-name stars jostle each other for their moment before the cameras."[10]Release
ReceptionPauline Kael of The New Yorker  called A Guide for the Married Man "a series of dumb skits", and felt
that the famous names in the cast are all wasted: "[W]hat they do is no more memorable than the plugs
for brand-name products that are scattered throughout."[11]
The film was released on DVD  on September 6, 2005, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment .[12]
