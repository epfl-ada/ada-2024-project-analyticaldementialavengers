You're Darn Tootin'  was filmed in January 1928. The title is an American idiomatic phrase akin to "You're
darn right! " The film was originally released in the UK under its working title The Music  Blasters . The
film was directed by fellow film comedian Edgar Kennedy  (billed as "E. Livingston Kennedy").
Scenes from You're Darn Tootin'  were  included in several silent film compilations of the 1960s produced
by Robert Youngson .
The film was shown on the BBC Four  programm e Paul Mert on's Silen t Clowns  in full with an original,
unique musical score.
Laur el and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies author Randy Skretvedt  wrote positively about You're
Darn Tootin' , saying the film "is the first clear statement of the essential idea inherent in Laurel and
Hardy . The world is not their oyster: they are the pearls trapped in the oyster . Their jobs hang by rapidly
unraveling threads. Their possessions crumble into dust. Their dreams die just at the point of fruition.
Their dignity is assaulted constantly . At times they can't live with each other , but they'll never be able to
live without each other. Each other is all they will ever have. That, and the hope for a better day — which
is about the most profound philosophical statement ever to come from a two-reel comedy ."[1]
British film critic Leslie Halliwell  commented, "...though early in their teaming [it] shows Stan and Ollie
at their best in a salt shaker routine and in a surreal pants-ripping contest."[2]Cast
Production notes
ReceptionThe Laurel & Hardy Encyclopedia'  author Glenn Mitch ell contrasts the expanding-mayhem finale with
earlier scenes, sayin g the film "contains what is in many respects the best of Laurel & Hardy's huge street
battles. So good is this climactic sequence that other sections tend to be ignored: the opening bandstand
segment is timed to a musical beat...."[3]
Bruce Calvert of Allmovie  commented that the film "is famous for the pants-ripping scene at the end, but
the other parts of it are just as funny .... The final pants-ripping scene is not funny just because so many
men lose their pants, but because Laure l and Hardy come up with inventive ways to pull more innocent
bystanders into the fray ."[4]
Writing in the 1960s, The Films of Laur el and Hardy author William K. Everson  appraised the film,
saying "The boarding house [dinner] is a charming sequence with Hardy's fruitless efforts to charm and
cajole the landlady .... The shin-kicking, pants-ripping finale is one of their best and most meticulously
constructed sequences of controlled savagery , similar to and in many ways better than the great pie fight
[of The Battle of the Century ]."[5]
