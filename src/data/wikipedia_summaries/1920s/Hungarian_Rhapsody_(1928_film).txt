Hungarian Rhapsody (1928 film)
Hungarian Rhap sody (German: Ungarische
Rhapsodie ) is a 1928 German  silent  drama film
directed by Hanns Schwarz  and starring Lil Dagover ,
Willy Fritsch and Dita Parlo .[1] It depicts the life of an
impoverished Hungarian aristocrat.
It was shot at the Babelsber g Studios  in Potsdam  and
on location  in Southern Hungary . Premiering at the
Ufa-Palast am Zoo, it was one of the most popular
German films released that year.[2] In 1929, a sound
version was prepared by Paramount Pictures  due to the
public's apathy to silent films. While the sound version
has no audible dialog, it features a synchronized
musical score with sound effects using both the sound-
on-disc and sound-on-film process. Since the sound
version was more widely seen, UFA producer Erich
Pommer  describe this film as his first "sound film",
rather than Melody of the Heart .[3]
The film's sets were  designed by the art director  Erich
Kettelhut .
