Men O' War
Men O' War is the third sound film starring Laurel and Hardy , released on June 29, 1929.
Stan and Ollie, two sailors enjoying a reprieve from duty, encounter two aesthetically pleasing women
during a leisurely stroll in the park. Eager to socialize, the sailors extend an invitation for refreshments,
only to realize their financial constraints - sufficient funds for only three beverages. A protracted
exchange ensues as Ollie endeavors to convey this dilemma to Stan, who struggles to comprehend the
necessity for sacrifice.
Upon finally procuring three sodas, their plans are thwarted when the price exceeds their initial
estimation. Ollie retaliates against Stan's earlier indiscretion by leaving him to settle the bill. However ,
Stan's luck takes a fortuitous turn when he wins a jackpot on a slot machine using a solitary coin.
Flush with unexpected wealth, the sailors rent a rowboat for a tranquil excursion with the ladies. Their
idyllic outing soon descends into chaos as they become embroiled in a tumultuous altercation with other
boaters on the lake, resulting in capsiz ed vessels and a mass exodus of drenched individuals seeking
refuge in Stan and Ollie's overcrowded boat, ultimately leading to its submersion.

Language EnglishThe difficulties of filming on location  during the early
sound era were present during the making of Men O'
War. Offscreen laughing from passersby present in
Hollenbeck Park during filming can be heard, and the
sound quality itself suffers from echoing and
background noise.[2]
This was James Finlayson 's first sound film, and the
one in which his trademark exclamation of "D'oh! "
appeared[2] (acknowledged by Dan Castellaneta  as the
progenitor for Homer Simpson 's similar expression of
disbelief or outrage).
