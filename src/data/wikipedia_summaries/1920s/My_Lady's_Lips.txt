Hal Erickson of AllRovi  made note that Clara Bow's role as the daughter of a media leader in this film
was well received albeit minor , and that film critics in 1926 did not like the casting of William Powell as
the hero Scott Seddo n, offering that "the actor would be wise to continue playin g villains lest he lose his
standing in Hollywood."[5]
Pittsbur gh Post-Gaz ette wrote that the film had a difficult time passing the Pennsylvania State Board of
Censors , and that actress Alyce Mills "made the most of" her role as "crook girl" Dora Blake, and that
William Powell was "excellent as the reporter".[6]

UCLA  Film and Television Archive .[2] Considered a "Sile nt Classic", the film was remastered by the
National Film Prese rvation Foundation .[7] The film screened in Italy in 2003 at the Pordenone Silent Film
Festival .[3]
