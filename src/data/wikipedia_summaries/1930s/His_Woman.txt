His Woman
His Woman  is a 1931 American pre-Code  romance
drama film directed by Edward Sloman  and starring
Gary Cooper  and Claudette Colbert .[1] Based on the
novel His Woman  by Dale Collins , the story is about a
tough sea captain who discovers a baby aboard his
freighter and hires a tramp, masquerading as a
missionary's daughter , to care for the infant on their
passage to New York.[1]
It is a remake of the 1928 film Sal of Singapor e.[1] The
1931 film was modest commercial success at the
time.[2]
While docked in a Caribbean port aboard a third-rate
freighter , Captain Sam Whalan gets involved in a
drunken brawl in a seedy tavern. Returning to the ship,
Sam discovers that a baby boy, rescued from a drifting
Navy boat, has been left for an unnamed sailor aboard
his ship. Deciding to adopt the child himself, Sam
advertises for a "mother" and soon hires Sally Clark as
the child's  nanny in exchange for her passage to New
York. Sally tells him she is the daughte r of a recently
deceased missionar y. Unknown to Sam, Sally is
actually a dance hall girl dressed to appear virtuous
and proper .
During the voyage, Sally takes loving care of the child
while Sam protects her from the lusty sailors on board.
One night , the first mate, Gatson, recognizes Sally
from a dance hall and tries to black mail her into
sleeping with him. Sally struggles to reject his
advances, and Sam comes to her rescue. In the ensuing
struggle, Gatson falls overboard. Unable to locate him
in the dense fog, he is assumed dead. By the time they
arrive in New York, Sam and Sally have fallen in love and intend to marry. The Department of
Commerce, however , calls Sam to testify in an investigation of the Gatson incident, and he is soon
arrested.PlotSam and Sally are surprised to learn that Gatson survived, was picked up by a cruise ship, and is now
pressing charges against Sam for assault and attempted murder . In the course of the investigation, in order
to clear Sam of the charges, Sally is forced to reveal her sordid past as a dance hall girl. Shocked and
disappointed by the revelation, Sam tells Sally to leave the ship, and decides to put the baby up for
adoption, despite Sally's sincere protest s. After sending his assistant Aloysius to deliver Sally's luggage,
Sam goes of f drinking with Gatson.
Later that night, a vengeful Sam brings  Gatson to Sally's apartment to insult her. When she learns from
another sailor that the baby was left out in the rain and is now sick, she immediately comes to care for the
infant with the help of a doctor . Sam postpones his next sailing mission until the child's fever breaks and
he begins to recover . By the time the baby is well and the ship pulls up anchor , Sam and Sally have made
amends and renew their plans to marry .
