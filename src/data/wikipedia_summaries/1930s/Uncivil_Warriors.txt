Uncivil Warriors
Uncivil Warriors  is a 1935 short subject  directed by
Del Lord starring American slapstick  comedy team
The Three Stooges  (Moe Howard , Larry Fine and Jerry
Howard ). It is the eighth entry in the series released by
Columbia Pictures  starring the comedians, who
released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and
1959.
Amidst the tumult of the American Civil War, a
strategic imperative  is established as a Union General
deploys Larry , Moe, and Curly — designated as
Operators 12, 14, and 15 respectively — to undertake a
clandestine mission behind enemy lines. Tasked with
securing vital intelligence, the trio assumes the guise of
Southern officers, adopting the aliases Lieutenant
Duck, Captain Dodge, and Major Hyde, respectively .
Their infiltration of the mansion belonging to
Confederate officer Colonel Butts  marks the
commencement of a series of misadventures.
Against the backdrop of preparations for a dinner
party , Curly's amorous inclinations towards Colonel
Butts' daughter , Judith Butts, precipitates a whimsical
episode as he inadvertently mistakes a quilted
potholder for a culinary confection, resulting in a
farcical sequence punctuated by fits of feather -induced
coughing. The narrative crescendos with Larry and
Curly donning elaborate disguises as Captain Dodge's
father and wife. Major "Bloodhound" Filbert's inquiry
about Captain Dodge's purported offspring prompts
Moe to produce a swaddled infant from the nearby
railroad station, whose unexpected racial identity
unveils the Stooges' subterfuge.
As the ruse unravels , the trio's desperate bid for escape
culminates in a frenetic pursuit, culmi nating in their
improbable refuge within a concealed cannon
disguised as a log. The ensuing chaos finds the UnionPlotLanguage English General incredulously pondering the whereabouts of
the elusiv e spies, only to be startled by the Stooges'
unanticipated descent from the sky .

Uncivil Warriors  was filmed on March 13–18, 1935.[2] It is the first short in which the Stooge s mention
"Good Time Charlie". When the Stooges meet a guard, they often reference Charlie. The guard asks who
Charlie is, and a Stooge replies that "everybody knows Charlie. He walks like this." The Stooges then
demonstrate a silly walk until they get clear of the guard, at which point they take off running. This is a
recurring joke in the Stooge shorts. In Uncivil Warriors , they actually meet a soldier named Charlie, who
asks the Stooges, "Are you all looking for me?"[3]Cast

Production notesThe potholder gag would later appear in the Shemp-era short Three Hams on Rye during a live theatrical
production.[3] A similar sequence also appears in the 1947 short All Gummed Up, also featuring Shemp.
The scene is nearly identical, with bubblegum being used in the place of a potholder , the stooges
coughing up bubbles rather than feathers as a result.
When Moe brings the black baby into the Colonel's office he attempts to explain how the baby got his
dark comp lexion ("We had him down the beach all summer ...he got quite sunburned!"); this is sometimes
deleted for U.S. television broadcasts.[3]
The introductory music over the titles is a medley of "Battle Hymn of the Republic " (most popular
marching song of the Union Army ) and " Dixie " (which had the same status in the Confederate Army ).[3]
