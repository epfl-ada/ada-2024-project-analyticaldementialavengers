There are two basic methods that business tycoons
employ to grow their wealth. Some leaders fight and
scratch and struggle to the top, destroying anyone and
anything that gets in their way. They use their wit and
the power of fear to great advantage, and they do
indeed rise to the top many times.[1] Some leaders
combine their wit to engage the help of many others
who will join them on their quest. Napo leon Hill, whoPlot

Historical contextwas taught the principles of wealth by Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford, calls it the ‘Master Mind
Group’  principle. One man of conviction and focus can accomplish great things indeed, but when one
man can, by use of a pleasing personality and a plan, convince a group of men and women to join him in
his vision, there is absolutely no limit to their efforts.[2] Jim Marley in this story is the first kind of
businessman. He will steal Flint's wife, contrive to dump a bucket of hot molten  steel on his partner Flint
to kill him, and continue to deceive and cheat everyone around him, until he alone owns every bit of the
mighty steel mill and the wealth that goes with it. Marley's partner Flint Dawson will lose his legs when
the molten steel is poured onto him, and while he is recovering in the hospital his wife will sell his half of
the steel mill and take the money and sail to Europe.[3] Flint  Dawson gets out of the hospital with no
money and no legs. The only thing he can do to earn his next meal is to become a beggar . But even
though Flint has no legs and no money , he has a brain and he has a plan. He can do what Marley could
never do. He can meet and befriend other beggars, . . . Thousands of beggars. One man with no legs, but
thousands of friends, can get the best kind of revenge on his partner Marle y. The very best kind of
revenge. Pop a big bowl of white kernel popcorn with plenty of warm melted butter drizzled over it and
enjoy the show .[4]
