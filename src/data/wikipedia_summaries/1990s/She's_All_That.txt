Zack Siler is the big man on campus at his Southern
California high school. After returnin g from spring
break, he finds out his girlfriend, Taylor , has cheated
on him with a reality TV star, Brock. After Zack and
Taylor's breakup, he consoles himself by claiming that
she is replaceable with any girl in the school. Zack's
friend Dean disagrees and bets Zack to turn any
random girl from school into the prom  queen in six
weeks. He accepts, so Dean chooses Laney Boggs, an
awkward and unpopular art student.
Zack attempts to befriend Laney , but she pointedly
ignores his advances until he asks for her help with art.
She reluctantly invites him to a small theater lounge
where she will perform. Intending to deter him, Laney
volunteers Zack to perform onstage. He manages toPlotCinematographyFrancis Kenny

impressed but still rejects him when Zack attempts to
charm her again.
When Zack shows up at her house, Laney reluctantly
agrees to go to the beach with him and his friends, and
they invite her to a party  later. Laney says she's busy,
but Zack persuades her to go. He enlists his sister ,
Mack, to give her a makeover . At the party, Taylor ,
who is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney ,
publicly humiliates her , bringing her to tears.
Laney is surprised to be nominated for prom queen,
along with Taylor . Zack then goes by her house and
asks about her mother , who died when Laney was
young, and talks about his father , who is pressuring
him to go to Dartmouth  for college . Zack leans in to
kiss Laney but pulls back when she jokes that it is just
to get her vote for prom king.
The next day, Zack defends Laney's brother , Simon, from bullies in the cafeteria. After a falling out with
Zack, Dean asks Laney to be his prom date. Taylor is humiliated when Brock dumps her, so she cozies up
to Zack. When he turns her down, she tells him that Dean has already asked Laney to the prom. When
Zack confronts him, Dean reveals the bet, forcing a public confession from Zack. A furious Laney rushes
from the room, refusing to speak to Zack.
Unable to reconcile with Laney , Zack takes his sister to the prom. After some persuading from her father ,
a disheartened Laney agrees to go with Dean. At the dance, Dean boasts of his plan to seduce Laney .
Laney's friend Jesse overhears, and he and Mack rush to warn Zack, who has taken the stage with Taylor
as Prom King and Queen. Zack rushes after Laney , who has already left with Dean.
Laney returns home  to find Zack is there . She explains how she avoided Dean's advances with a fog horn.
Zack confesses his true feelings, and they share a dance and kiss by the pool. Laney asks Zack about the
bet, and he says mysteriously he will honor the terms. On the day of graduation he appears onstage nude
except for cap and a soccer ball, getting applause from the crowd and a smile from Laney .

The film had an ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin , Oscar  winner Anna
Paquin , Jodi Lyn O'Keefe , musician Usher Raymond , Gabrielle Union  in her film debut, Dulé Hill, and
Lil' Kim.[6][7] Prod ucer Richard N. Gladstein  noted, "There were other films that you could've seen them
in, but they weren't usually the leads in those films."[6] According to director Robert Iscove , Miramax  co-
head Harvey Weinstein  was very involved in script development and casting, and was able to get great
actors in very small parts as a personal favor .[8]
Iscove said Josh Hartnett  was considered for the role of Zack Siler, and many actresses were considered
for the role of Laney Boggs, including Mena Suvari , Leelee Sobieski , and Jordana Brewster .[8][9]
Kevin Pollak  said he signed up for the movie in part because he was impressed with Freddie Prinze Jr.’s
performance in The House of Y es a few years earlier and was interested in working with him.[10][8]Production
Casting
WritingR. Lee Fleming Jr. is officially credited as the sole screenwriter for the film.  In a 2002 interview , M.
Night Shyamalan  stated that he polished  the screen play while adapting Stuart Little and writi ng a spec
script  for The Sixth Sense . This was also confirmed in the film's audio commentary by Iscove.[11]
In 2013, Shyamalan  claimed that, rather than simply polishing Fleming's original script, he actually
ghost-wrote  the film.[12] This was disputed by Fleming.[13][14] Jack Lechner (who  served as Miramax's
head of development in the late 1990s) confirmed that technically both Shyamalan and Fleming
contributed to the script: Fleming wrote  the initial script that Miramax bought, while Shyamalan did an
uncredited rewrite (doing more than "a polish") that got the film green-lit. Lech ner reiterated that content
from both writers was included in the final cut of the film.[15][16] Prod ucer Richard N. Gladstein said that
the script "was pretty much done" already, but that Shyamalan's changes "helped enormously with the
relationship with Kevin Pollak [who played Laney's father , Wayne]".[6] Iscove attributed the performance
art piece and the hacky sack sequence to Shyamalan.[8] Fleming attributed the line "Am I a fucking bet?"
to Shyamalan.[17] Flem ing included various pop culture references in his script: Laney Boggs was named
after two characters played by Winona Ryder, Kim Boggs from Edwar d Scissor hand s and Laney Pierce
from Reality Bites ;[8] the characters Zack and Taylor were named after two of the three members of the
band Hanson .[8] Pollak constantly guessing Jeopar dy! answers incorrectly  is a running joke, which he
previously did in the 1997 film Truth or Consequen ces, N.M. . The idea was in Fleming's script but Pollak
expanded and improvised his answers.[8]
Iscove was influenced by the movies of John Hugh es and was trying do something different for the '90s
generation that would still resonate. He stressed the importance of the story having a heart, how Zack had
to be worthy of Laney , and how Laney had to learn to be more open.[18] The story  was rewritten to better
fit Prinze Jr. and make Zack a more sympathetic character with his own challenges.[5] Iscove was well
aware that it was implausible to suggest Rachael Leigh Cook  was ugly, but said it was standard practice
in Hollyw ood to cast "the beautiful girl" and that it requires the audience to suspend their disbelief: "You
either go along with it or you don't go along with it." Comparing Laney's transformation to that of Clark
Kent into Superman , Iscove said casting  the role was more about finding an actor who had the range to
give the necessary performance.[5]
Filming took place from August 6, 1998, to September 28, 1998, in various California locations.[19] The
high school scenes were shot at Torrance High School , where television series Buffy the Vampir e Slayer
and Beverly Hills, 90210  were previously filmed.[8][20]
Iscove was also a choreographer and wanted to expand and embellish the prom scenes, while also
showing the Weinsteins how musical numbers could work in films. The dance scene was choreographed
by Adam Shankman  at the request of the film's co-producer Jennifer Gibgot, who is Shankman's sister .
Shankman was assisted by Anne Fletcher. Shankma n was concerned about the scene not tonally meshing
with the rest of the film, but Iscove persisted. Test audiences did not understand  why the dance scene was
happening, so Bob Weinstein  asked for a reshoot with Usher to link the scene.[18] Shankman also worked
with Matthew Lillard  on his solo dance scenes.[8][18]
Costume designer Denise Wingate said, "We had no budget so we had to be really creative—everything
in that prom scene was white, black, and gold, and we got it all from The Salvation Army  and just
completely reworked it." Having majored in psychology , Wingate tried to explore the possible reasons forFilmingthe characters’  wardrobe. Wingate concluded that Laney wore clothes like armor after the death of her
mother , but also wanted to express herself as an artist, resulting in a mix of vintage clothes, overalls,
aprons, and various quirky t-shirts. The falafel restaurant hat was created on short notice with items
picked up from a Michaels  craft store. Laney' s transformation was reflected in the red dress, which
demonstrated "a bold statement of her dressing in a color that was so different  than anything we’d seen
her in before."[21] Leigh Cook recall ed "feeling really self-conscious” in the scene where she first
descends the stairs in the dress. There were two versions of the red dress: a stunt double dress reserved
for the scene when Laney falls down in a driveway outside a party , and a second smaller dress, which left
Cook holding her breath trying to get through the scene quickly .[22][23]
The song "Kiss Me" was used as the main theme song. The film's box office success helped "Kiss Me" to
gain widespread mainstream attention and chart success. It climbed to No. 2 on Billboar d's Hot 100 list,
and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 straight weeks and No. 4 in the UK and New Zealand.
The film was released in Italy with the title "Kiss Me".[18][8][5]SoundtrackTrack

On review  aggregato r Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 63 reviews, with
an average rating of 5/10. The website's  critics consensus states: "Despite its charming young leads, She's
All That can't overcome its predictable, incons istently funny script."[24] On Metacritic , the film has a
weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[25]
It was the last movie to be reviewed by Gene Siskel  before his death in February 1999. Siskel gave a
positive review and wrote, "Rachael Leigh Cook, as Laney , the plain Jane object of the makeover , is
forced to demonstrate the biggest emotional range as a character , and she is equal to the assignment."[26]
Roger Ebert  suggested: "To give the movie credit, it's as bored with the underlying plot as we are. Even
the prom queen election is only a backdrop for more interesting material, as She's All That explores
differences in class and style, and peppe rs its screenplay with very funny little moments." Ebert says it "isReception
Critical responsenot a great movie, but it has its moments", giving it 2.5 out of 4 stars.[27] Stephen Holden  of The New
York Times praised Cook for her performance, comparing her to Winona Ryder, saying, "Unlike so many
actors playing smart young people, she actually projects some intelligence along with a sly sense of
comedy ."[28]
Mick LaSalle  of the San Francisco Chronicle  calls it "About one idea short of being an excellent teenage
romance. As it stand s it's a pleasing but routine effort." LaSalle criticized the film for running out of plot
about halfway , saying the "story line is stretched to the breaking point. In one instance, director Robert
Iscove stops the action for a long dance sequence, set at the prom, that has nothing to do with anything."
He commented the film is "intermittently funny" and praised Matthew Lillard's performance, calling it
the best thing in the picture.[29]
Geof f Berkshire of Variety  was critical of the lack of originality , and wrote, "Suggesting that Miramax
needs to put Kevin Williamson  on perma nent retain er if it's going to remain in the teen-pics field, She's
All That notably fails to bring to comedy the insight that the Williamson-penned Scream brought so
memorably to horror". Berkshire was positive about the two leads, saying "appealing young actors come
off as competent, nothing more, given a context that can't be transcended." He described the direction as
"nothing to be asham ed of here, but nothing of any distinction, either", and noted the soundtrack as a not
unexpected plus.[30] Jane Ganahl of the San Francisco Examiner  wrote, "And once, just once, I'd love to
see a teen flick that doesn't send out a message to young girls that to be accepta ble, you have to conform.
I liked the artist girl much better before."[31]
William Thomas of Empir e criticized the film, saying that despite a few scenes, "The rest is just breezy
propaganda for American high school fascism", and "The most worrying thing about She's All That is its
message. The 'ugly duck ling' (specs, dungarees, art-lover) must conform (she gets a makeover and the
boys notice her "bobos" for the first time) to fit in."[32]
She's All That premiered on January 19, 1999 at the Mann Festival Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles .[33]
The film went into general release on January 29.[3]
The film was released in Italy with the title "Kiss Me".[18][8][5]
The film reached No. 1 at the box office in the first week of its release, grossing $16.1 million over the
Super Bow l opening weekend.[3] It earned $63.4 million in the United  States and $39.8 million at
international box offices, totaling $103. 2 million worldwide against a productio n budget between $7–10
million.[3] Miramax spent a further $18 million on television advertising to promote the film.[8]
The film won eight awards, and was nominated for five others.Box office
