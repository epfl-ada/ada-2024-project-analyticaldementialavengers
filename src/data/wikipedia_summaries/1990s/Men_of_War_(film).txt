Men of War (film)
Men of War is a 1994  action film directed by Perry
Lang , written by John Sayles , and revised by Ethan
Reiff and Cyrus Voris. It stars Dolph Lundgren  as Nick
Gunar , a former Special Ops soldier who leads a group
of mercenaries to a treasure island in the South China
Sea.
Nick Gunar , an ex-soldier , is down and out in Chicago
in a typica lly cold winter . When two men offer him a
job on a tropical island, he reluctantly agrees and
gathers together a group of soldier friends also down
on their luck. They arrive in the Far East and come up
against the evil Keefer , who was with Nick in Angola.
He now owns the local police force and shows Nick
and the others who is boss. Afterwards, Nick and his
crew go to the island, which they find is occupied by
peaceful natives—n atives who the mercenaries are
supposed to convince to abandon the island. Nick
respects them, but there is friction caused by a few
mercenaries who want to kill natives to persuade them
to leave, or, alternat ively , to get them to divulge where
a suspected treasure might be. Nick stops them and
finds out the "treasure" they are after is guano (which
does have value in sufficient quantities). The two men
paying the mercenaries intend to strip mine  the island
to get it, leaving the natives and their homes as
casualties. The group divides up, with half wishing to
finish the job for which they were paid, and the other
half, led by Nick, wishing to protect the islanders. Nick
hands the former group their pay and orders them to
leave the island as he refuses to kill the natives to do
the job.
Meanwhile, Keefer and the Colonel, who suspect there
is money to be made, join the group Nick kicked out.
They then storm the island with many new
mercenaries, hoping to force off or exterminate Nick,
his soldier s, and the natives. Many of the invaders arePlotDecember 19, 1995

battle. Though poorly armed, the natives make up for
this in trickery and local knowledge. Nick has a
bazooka-style weapon (a Carl Gustav ), which causes
mayhem. After a number of attacks by both sides,
many are dead and there is a final showdown between
Nick and Keefer; Keefer gains the upper hand in the
fist fight and attemp ts to strangle Nick to death while
drowning him. Nick manages to grab a nearby bone
and stab Keefer in the neck, then proceeds to drown
him. As the natives bury their dead, the few surviving mercenaries leave, but Nick stays behind.

The film was based on an original screenplay by John Sayles called A Safe Place , written in the early
1980s for producer Stan Rogow .[3][4] Sayles' original idea for the plot involved a mercenary who rethinks
his life when he comes upon a tribe of pacifists. Rewrites from Reiff and Voris added more testosterone-
fueled action.[5]
According to Voris:
It was actually an old Sayles script that some producers bought and wanted  to make for
action star Dolph Lundgren! The Sayles script needed to be brought up to date a little, more
action scenes added and, most importantly , had to be made into an ensemble movie because
the producers were worried that Dolp h just couldn't carry the movie that John Sayles
originally wrote. And that an audience wouldn't sit still to watch Lundgren tackle all thoseCast
Productiongreat John  Sayles monologues. ... We were actually pretty deferential to Sayles' original
script and the finished movie is actually quite a good little action flick. ... Probably the only
time we'll ever get a chance to rewrite John Sayles.[6]
The original script featured a prologue set in Afghanistan.[7]
Filming took place in Thailand between September and December 1993,[8] and production officially
ended in January 1994. Following the excellent test screenings reactions that the movie had, Miramax
had bought it from another company with a promise of theatrical release, but then they dumped it on
video because they thought that Dolph Lundgren couldn't bring the audience if he was main hero in the
film. This is why movie was shelved and delayed until December 1995 when it was released on video in
US, although it was released earlier in some other countries, like for example  in France (in July 1995)
where although it wasn't success it got great reviews from critics. John Sayles, who wrote the original
script (before it was partially re-written to add more action and humor) also said some years later how it
was very good action movie and some of Lundgren's best work.[9]
Vision International sold the rights to distribution at the 1993 American Film Market .[10] Dimension
initially released Men of War in the United States in 1995.[11] On November 14, 2000, Dimension
released the film on DVD in the United States in Region 1. On February 23, 2009, Anchor Bay
Entertainment  released it on DVD in the United Kingdom in Region 2.[12]
Michael Sauter of Entertainment W eekly  rated it C− and called it a "straight-to-video clunker".[13]
Susan King of the Los Angeles T imes called it "a better -than-average straight-to-video action thriller ."[14]
Leigh Riding of DVDactive rated it 7/10 stars and called it "a sturdy action drama" that is "surprisingly
intriguing and entertaining".[12]
Rachel Adams and David Savran in their book The mascu linity studies reader  said "Men of War invokes
the most vividly remembered fighting  in a foreign land of recent Western history . This innovation,
associating the muscle image with the Vietnam experience, is carried over into other contemporary
muscle films."[15]
Mick Martin and Marsha Porter said in the DVD & video guide 2005  said, "fine performances by an all-
star Dolph Lundgren as a mercenary assigned to "convince" a cast in this of fbeat and disturbing film."[16]
