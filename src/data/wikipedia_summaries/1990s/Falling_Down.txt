thriller film[3][4] direc ted by Joel Schumacher , written
by Ebbe Roe Smith  and released by Warner Bros. in
the United States on February 26, 1993.[5]
The film stars Michael Douglas  as William Foster , a
divorced and unemp loyed former defense  engineer . It
centers on Foster's trek across the city of Los Angel es
as he attempts to reach the house of his estranged ex-
wife in time for his daughter's birthday . Along the way,
a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative,
cause him to react with increasing violence and to
make sardonic observations on life, poverty , the
economy , and commercialism.
The film received  generally positive reviews. It
grossed $96 million against a $25 million budget,
taking the top spot at the United States box office in its
first two weeks of release.
William Foster is stuck in Los Angeles  traffic on a hot
day. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his
car and begins walking, carrying his briefcase.
At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to
give chan ge for a telephone call. Foster becomes
agitated over the high prices. The owner grabs a
baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the
bat and destroys several merchandise displays before
leaving. Later , while resting on a hill, he is harassed by
two Mexican gang members, who threaten him with a
knife and demand his briefcase. Foste r attacks them
with the bat and takes their knife.
The gang members,  now in a car with two associates,
find Foster using a payphone . They open fire, killing
four surro unding bystanders, but not Foster . The driver
crashes. Foster picks up an UZI they had, shoots thePlotRelease date February 26, 1993

bag of weapons. Foster encounters a panhandler  who
harasses him for change. Foster finally gives him the
briefcase, which only contains his lunch.
At a fast food restaurant, Foster attempts to order
breakfast, but is told they have switched to the lunch
menu. After an argument with the manager , Foster
pulls a gun and fires into the ceiling accidentally . After
trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the
burger looks nothing like the one on the menu. After Foster calls "home" again and states his intention to
attend his daughter Adele's birthday party , his ex-wife Beth notifies the police because she has a
restraining order  against him.
Sergeant Martin Prender gast, who is on his last day of duty before being coaxed into retirement by his
wife, insists on investigating the events . Interviews with witnesses lead Prend ergast to suspect that the
same person is responsible for all of them. Foster's vanity license plate proves to be an important lead,
because Prender gast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prender gast and
his partner , Detective Sandra Torres, visit Foster's mother , who is surprised to learn that he lost his job.
They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in Venice  and rush to intercept him.
Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan. The man exchanges a
glance with Foster and says, "Don't forget me," as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military
surplus store  to buy boots. The owner , a homophobic Neo-Nazi , diverts Torres when she comes in. After
Torres leaves, the owner offers Foster a rocket launcher  and congratulates him for the shooting incident at
the restaurant. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's bigotry , the man becomes violent and
attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him then shoots him dead. Foster changes into
army clothes, takes the rocket launcher and leaves.
Foster encounters a road repair crew who are not working and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs
to justify their budge t. He pulls out the rocket launcher but struggles to use it, until a boy explains how it
works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. By the time Foster reaches
Beth's house, she has already fled with their daughter . He realizes that they may have gone to nearby
Venice Pier, but Prender gast and Torres  arrive before he can pursue them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring
her, and flees with Prender gast in pursuit.
At the pier, Foster confronts his ex-wife and daughter . Adele is happy to see him, but Beth wants him to
leave. Prender gast arrives and distracts Foster long enough for Beth to throw his gun into the ocean.
Prender gast holds Foster at gunpoint and urges him to surrender . With nothing left for him, Foster tricks
Prender gast into shooting him dead . Having asserted himself, Prender gast decides to hold of f retirement.

Falling Down was being  filmed in various locations in Lynwood, California , when the 1992 Los Angeles
riots began. By April 30, the riots were sufficiently disruptive to force filming to stop early that day.[6]
Film crews produced more footage inside of Warner Bros. Studio, in Burbank , as the riots continued. By
May 4, when the crew intended to resume in Pasadena , initial requests to do so were denied,  causing
delays.[7] Filming wrapped in late June 1992.[8] Productio n designer  Barbara Ling said: "We mapped this
so that you really were going across [Los Angeles] from Silver Lake down to mid-city to Koreatown."[9]
In an interview less than a week before Falling Down 's release, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith gave his
interpretation of what the movie was about. "To me, even though the movie deals with complicated urban
issues, it really is just about one basic thing: The main character represents the old power structure of the
U.S. that has now become archaic, and hopelessly lost. For both of them, it's adjust-or -die time  ..."[10]
Foster's signature haircut was the idea of Joel Schumacher  and the movie's hairstylist, Lynda Gurasich.
Douglas commented on how it helped him get into the character of a veteran of the military or defense
industry: "It gave me the feeling of the late '50s and the early '60s, and somehow  my character you kinda
have the feeling that he came from another time, or he wished or he hoped for another time when thingsProduction
Development
Castingmade sense." Douglas would add concerning the character: "There's a lot of people who are a paycheck
away from being on the streets and being out of work who did everything right,  they've been responsible,
they tried hard, [and] they don't know what went wrong! We won the war, where's it all at?"[11]
The film grossed $96 million against a $25 million budget. It took the top spot at the United States box
office in its first two weeks of release (February 26–28 and March 5–7, 1993). Falling Down pushed the
previous top movie, Groundhog Day, into the second place box-of fice spot for both those weeks.[12] It
grossed $40.9 million in the United States and Canada and $55.1 million internationally .[13][2]
Falling Down holds an approval rating of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes  based on 56 review s, with an average
rating of 6.80/10. The site's consensus  states: "Falling Down's popcorn -friendly take on its complex
themes proves disquieting—and ultimately fitting for a bleakly entertaining picture of one man's angry
break with reality ."[14] However , the film also has a weighted average  score of 56 out of 100 on
Metacritic  based on 21 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[15][16] Audiences surveyed by
CinemaScore  gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.[17]
Contemporary reviews of Falling Down  were generally mixed to positive.
Vincent Canby  of The New York Times called it "the most interesting, all-out commercial American film
of the year to date, and one that will function much like a Rorschach test to expose  the secrets of those
who watch  it."[5] Philip Thomas of Empir e wrote in his review  of the film: "While the morality of D-
Fens's methods are questionable, there 's a resonance about his reaction to everyday annoyances, and
Michael Douglas' hypnotic performanc e makes it memorable."[18] James Berardinelli  wrote: "Falling
Down  is replete with gallows humor , almost to the point where it could be classified as a 'black
comedy '."[19] John Truby calls the film "an anti-Odyssey  story" about "the lie of the American
Dream ".[20] He adds: "I can't remember laughing so hard in a movie."[20] Kenneth Turan of the Los
Angeles Times wrote: "Falling Down  encourages a gloati ng sense that we the long-suf fering victims are
finally getting our splendid revenge. The ultimate hollowness of that kind of triumph reflects the
shallowness of a film all too eager to serve it up."[21]
Roger Ebert , who gave the film a positive review at the time of its release, wrote:
Some will even find it racist because the targets of the film's hero are Africa n American,
Latino, and Korean—with a few white s thrown in for balance. Both of these approaches
represent a facile reading of the film, which is actually about a great sadness, which turns
into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that
he is unnecessary and irrelevant... What is fascinating about the Douglas charact er, as written
and played, is the core of sadness in his soul. Yes, by the time we meet him, he has gone overReception
Box office
Critical reception
Contemporarythe edge. But there is no exhilaration  in his rampage, no release. He seems weary and
confused, and in his actions he unconsciously follows scripts that he may have learned from
the movie s, or on the news, where other frustrated misfits vent their rage on innocent
bystanders.[22]
The W ashington Post  writer Hal Hinson  observed:
This guy is you, the movie suggests, and if not you exactly , then maybe the guy you're one or
two bad breaks from becoming. At one time or another , we've all thought these thoughts, and
so when this downtrodden, laid-of f, teed-of f L.A. defense worker gets out of his car on a
sweltering day in the middle of rush hour and decides he's not going to take any more, it
comes as no surpris e", adding "as he did in Fatal Attraction  and Wall Street, Douglas again
takes on the symbolic mantle of the Zeitgeist . But in Falling Down , he and Schumache r want
to have their cake and eat it too; they want him to be a hero and a villain, and it just won't
work.[23]
Peter Travers  of Rolling Stone  gave the film four stars out of five, writing:
There's no denying the power of the tale or of Douglas's riveting performance— his best and
riskiest since Wall Street. Douglas neither demonizes nor canonizes this flawed character .
Marching across a violent urban landscape toward an illusory home, this shatter ed Everyman
is never less than real ... "I'm the bad guy?"  he asks in disbelief. Douglas speaks the line with
a searing poignancy that illuminates uncomfortable truths without excusing the character .
Schumacher could have exploited those tabloid headlines about solid citizens going berserk.
Instead, the timely , gripping Falling Down  puts a human face on a cold statistic and then
dares us to look away .[24]
Mick LaSalle  said of the film in the San Francisco Chr onicle :
A few times every year, Hollywood makes a mistake, violates formula, and actually makes a
great picture. Falling Down  is one of the great mistakes of 1993, a film too good and too
original to win any Oscars, but one bound to be remembered in years to come as a true and
ironic statement about life in our time.[25]
At the time of its release, Douglas's father, actor Kirk Doug las, declared:  "He played it brilliantly . I think
it is his best piece of work to date."[26] He also defended the film against critics who claimed that it
glorifies lawbreaking: "Michael's character is not the 'hero' or 'newest urban icon'. He is the villain and
the victim. Of course, we see many elem ents of our society that contributed to his madness. We even pity
him. But the movie never condones his actions."[26]
Falling Down was released in theatres less than one year after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, during which
Korean Americans and their businesses were targeted by rioters. The Korean American Coalition[27] and
Korean Grocers Association[28] prote sted the film for its treatment of minorities, especially the Korean
grocer . Warner Bros. Korea cancelled the release of Falling Down  in South Korea  following boycott
threats.[29] The outcr y by the Grocers Association led to Michael Douglas meeting with the organization'smembers at the Warner Bros. Studio because they "were there and they were pissed. So we had a
conversation and I told them, 'Look, I'm very sorry , but there's a reason the screenwriter picked certain
things to put in the film.'"[30] Unemployed defense workers were also angered at their portrayal in the
film.[27]
The character of D‑FENS was featured on magazine covers, including the March 29, 1993, issue[31] of
Newsweek , and reported upon as an embodiment of the " angry white man " stereotype.[32]
On the 24th anniversary of the film's release in 2017, film critic April Wolfe of LA Weekly  wrote in the
article entitled "Hey White People..." that it "remains one of Hollywood's most overt yet morally complex
depictions of the modern white-victimization narrative, one both adored and reviled by the extreme
right". Wolfe said: "Today , we might see D-Fens and the white supremacist as the infighting sides of the
far right — one couches racism in coded words like "thug," while the other wants an outright ethnic
cleanse. Ultimately , what both want is to return to their idea of a purer America, unburdened by the
concerns of minorities and women". Wolfe suggested that Rupert Murdoch  would "go on to bottle that
fury and package it as patriotism" in creating Fox News .[33]
In 2012, Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club  was critic al of the film, describing it as a "profoundly hateful
film disguised alternately (and erratically) as either tragedy or humor ."[34] An earlier  2008 review on the
site was positive, saying, "Heat used as a metaphor for simmering rage is nothing new, but few films
execute sweaty psychosis as well."[35]

Falling Down  has been the inspiration of musical artists such as Iron Maiden , Foo Fighters , Front Line
Assembly  and Heart Attack Man. The Iron Maiden song "Man on the Edge " is a basic summary of
Falling Down , beginning with describing the opening traffic jam, and ending with describing the birthday
present Foster buys for his daughter . The Foo Fighters' song "Walk" has a music video that is a recreation
of scenes from Falling Down. The Front Line Assembly album Millennium  contains several samples from
various scenes from Falling Down .[38] The Heart Attack Man song "Out For Blood" was inspired by the
anger and frustration weaved through Falling Down  whic h weaves throu gh the rest of their album Fake
Blood .
In the video game Tony Haw k's Americ an Wasteland , a character resembling Foster recreate s the rocket
launcher scene in a cutscene , blowing up a construction site before walking away with a duf fel bag.[39]
An episode of the animated series Duckman  titled "A Room with a Bellevue" (episode six of season
three), is loosely based on the plot of Falling Down. Duckman  has to pick up his new suit from the dry
cleaner to be presentable on his children's birthday , but huge traf fic and the law are going to stop him.Later opinions
