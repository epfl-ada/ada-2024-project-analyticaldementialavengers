Film Socialisme
Film Socialisme  (alternative French title Socialisme ;
English: Socialism  but often referred to as Film
Socialism ) is a 2010 French postmodern  drama  film
directed by Jean-Luc Godard .
The film was first screened in the Un Certai n Regard
section at the 2010 Cann es Film Festival ,[2] to a widel y
varying reception, and released in France  two days
later, on 19 May 2010. It screened at the 48th New
York Film  Festival  in 2010, the 27th film that Godard
has shown at the festival.[3]
According to the synopsis on the film's official
website,[4] the film is composed of three movements:
The first movement, Des choses comme ça
("Such things") is set on a cruise ship ,
featuring multi-lingual conversations among a
motley collection of passengers. Characters
include an aging war criminal , a former United
Nations  official, and a Russian detective.
There is a brief cameo appearance  by
American singer-songwriter and artist Patti
Smith .[5]
The second movement, Notre Europe  ("Our
Europe"), is set at a gas station and involves a
pair of children, a girl and her younger brother ,
summoning their parents to appear before the
"tribunal of their childhood", demanding
serious answers on the themes of liberty ,
equality , and fraternity .
The final movement, Nos humanités  ("Our
humanities"), visits six legendary sites: Egypt ,
Palestine , Odessa , Greece , Naples  and Barcelona .

Christian Sinniger: the father

Principal photography  bega n in 2008, and the film was originally scheduled for a 10 January 2010
release, but an extended post-production  delayed its release.[6][7] Most of the film was shot around the
Mediterranean Sea .
The film is Godard's first in HD video  and the 16:9 aspect ratio, as well as his first in several decades not
be photographed with an intended aspec t ratio of 4:3. Though Godard was one of the first major directors
to shoot and edit on video, and has incorporated video footage and editing into most of his work since the
mid-1970s, this is the first theatrical release from him to be shot entirely in a digital format . As with many
of his films, Godard's partner Anne-Marie Miéville  worked on the film, other people credited as
collaborators being Fabrice Aragno  and Louma Sanbar , who also have worked with Godard before.
The cruise ship is the Costa Concor dia,[5] sailing around the Mediterranean Sea. This ship was wrecked
in real life  in January 2012.
The shoot ing aboard  the cruise ship was documented in Film catas trophe  (http://ww w.filmcatastrophe.co
m) by Paul Grivas.
Reviews for Film Socialisme  were mixed. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes  reports an approval
rating of 58%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 5.37/10. The website's consensus reads,
"Godard continues to explore new modes of expression in Film Socialisme , an avant garde essay on
societal decay that will resonate stronge st among the already converted."[8] Metacritic  reported the film
had an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 13 reviews.[9]
Michael Phillips , film critic for the Chicago Tribune , gave the movie three stars out of four, writing,
"Those receptive to Godard's sense of humor will find Film Socialisme  an elusiv e yet expansive
provocation. Those less receptive will find it elusive, period".[10]Production
Critical r esponseBritish film critic Mark Kermode  attended the premiere screening at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival ,
describing it later as the worst film of the festival.[11][12] Kermode would include Film Socialisme  in his
list of the worst ten films of 2011,[13] as well as including it on his list of the 10 worst films released
between 2008 and 2018.[14]
Roger Ebert  described the film as "an affront. It is incoherent, maddening, deliberately  opaque and
heedless of the ways in which people watch movies."[15]

2010 Cannes Film Festival  - Un Certain Regard  category
2010 Toronto International Film Festival  - Masters category
