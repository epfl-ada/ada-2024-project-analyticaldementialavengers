Loot (2011 film)
Loot  is a 2011 Hindi -language crime comedy  film
directed by Rajnish Raj Thakur , written by S.M. Sabir
Firozabadi, and produced by Shabbir  Boxwala and
Anup Gandhi under the Popcorn Motion Pictures
banner . The film stars Govinda , Suniel Shetty,
Mahaakshay Chakraborty , Jaaved Jaaferi , Shweta
Bhardwaj , and Ravi Kishan . It was released on 4
November 2011, to mixed reviews from critics and
was a commercial failure.[1] The film is a loose remake
of the 2003 film, Crime Spr ee.
Loot revolves around the misadventures of four
criminals, comprising Builder (Suniel Shetty), Pandit
(Govinda ), Akbar (Jaaved Jaaferi ), and Wilson
(Mahaakshay Chak raborty ), who work for one
Batliwala (Dalip Tahil). The four rogues are sent on a
mission to Pattaya  to rob a house filled with priceless
valuables. However , the quartet soon discovers that the
house they have been sent to rob belongs to a dreaded
don named Lalla Bhatti (Mahesh Manjrekar ), an
unpleasant sod who doesn't think twice about breaking
his own brother's arm (Shehzad Khan ) for an unpaid
debt. If robbing a don's residence was not enough, the
quarter also managed to get in the way of a 'poetic'
spouting intelligence agent VP Singh (Ravi Kishan )
keeping tabs on the don, an underworld patriarch Khan
(Prem Chopra ), and an East Asian thug named Asif
trying to trace his stolen car. Pretty  soon, all the
characters of the film are pulled into a cat-and-mouse
game with each other , with some audio tapes
containing some damning conversatio ns being the
prize of the game. In the climax, the quartet, with some
help from a local hustler , Varinder (Mika Singh ) and
his moll Sharmili (Kim Sharm a), manage to set off the
bad guys against each other . But soon enough, it is
revealed that Batliwala was behind the whole thing and
wanted to set the quartet up to get revenge on hisPlotRelease date 4 November 2011
