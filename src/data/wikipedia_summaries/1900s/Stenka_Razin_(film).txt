Stenka Razin (film)
Stenka Razin  (Russian : Стеньк а-Разинъ ), also called
Free Men  of the Volga,[1]: 11  is a 1908 silent film. It is
generally considered the first Russian feature film .[2]
The film dramatizes a popular story about the
historical Cossack  leader Stenka Razin . In the film's
narrative, Razin falls in love with a captured Persian
princess. His followers object to his love and try to
denigrate her, first by interrupting her seductive dance
with a Russian dance of their own, then by framing her
for infidelity . They successfully turn Razin against the
princess, and he throws her into the Volga.[3]
Stenka Razin  was produced by Alexander Drankov .
Previously a photo journalist and official photographer
for the Duma  and Nicholas II,[2] Drankov opened the
first Russian film studio in 1907 and began producing
documentaries in February 1908.[3][4]: 31–32 
Drankov advertised  Stenka Razin  as Russ ia's first
feature, although it was not his first attempt.[1]: 12  He
had previously attempted to film an adaption of Boris
Godunov , but due to production difficulties  and
tensions with the actors, it was never completed. While
filming Boris Godunov , Drankov frequently had to
move and rebuild sets as the light changed, which led
him to avoid constructing sets for Stenka Razin .[5] The
scenes set on the Volga were filmed on Lake Razliv
near Saint Petersbur g.[3]
The film was origin ally conceived by Vasily Goncharov  as part of an experimental play: the begin ning
and end of the play would be pre-recorded and projected on screen, while the middle would be performed
live. Goncharov hired Alexander Drankov to film the opening and closin g footage, but Drankov
convinced Goncharo v to let him film the middle scenes as well. Without seeking Goncharov's permission
or crediting him, Drankov released his combined footage as a stand-alone film one day before the play'sPlot
ProductionStenka Razinpremiere. Goncharo v complained to the Union of Dramatic and Musical Writers , demandin g they protect
his author ship right s. However , the union refused to intervene, as they did not consider Goncharov's
experiment to be literary .[6]
Stenka Razin  starred Yevgeny Petrov-Kra yevsky , an actor from the Petrograd People's House theater , who
would later direct films for Drankov's studio.[2] It is not known who played the princess.[3] Little is
known about the director , Vladimir Romashko v, who did not direct another picture.[1]: 12  Mikhail
Ippolitov-Ivanov  wrote a score for the film, which built on the popular folk song Down Along Mother
Volga.[1]: 13  Drankov encouraged audiences to sing the folk song, popularly known as the "drunkard's
ballad", during the film.[3][4]: 35 
The film tells its story through a series of distinct "tableau" scenes,
possibly modeled after lubok  prints.[3] The shots are almost
entirely static, with "barely perceptible" camera movement.[7]
The historical figure Stenka Razin was a symbol of resistance
against oppression, and his story appeal ed to an audience who had
experienced the Russian Revolution of 1905 .[4] The film is loosely
based on the folk song From the Island to the Deep Stream,[1]: 13 
which would have been well known  to the film's audience,
reducing the need for exposition.[3]: 35  Denise Youngbloo d and
Rimgaila Salys consider the film a politically conservative  version
of the song's story , both noting that Razin is portrayed as a violent
drunk rather than a hero of the common people.[8][3]
Rachel Morley notes that earlier version s of the Razin story did not depict the princess as a dancer . She
suggests that the newly-added dance motif links the princess to Salome , whose story had recently been
popularized in a play by Oscar Wilde (translated into Russian in 1904) and a 1905 opera  by Richard
Strauss .[1]: 26–28  Morley sees the film as reflecting a tension between personal pleasure (repre sented by
the princess) and duty to the Motherland (represented by the Volga, the primacy of which is established in
the opening scene), as well as anxieties about social changes in Russia, over which traditional patriarchy
ultimately triumphs.[1]: 22–30 Style and themes
Release and r eceptionThe film was an immediate success and helped establish the Russian film industry .[3] Contemporary
reviews were highly positive, but modern reception is mostly negative, with retrospective reviews
criticizing the film's minimal camerawork as well as its crude acting and blocking.[1]: 13–14
