The Call of the Wild (1908 film)
The Call of the Wild is a 1908  American short  silent
Western  film directed by D. W. Griffith and produced
by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company .
The short,  a "one-reeler ", stars Charles Inslee, Harry
Solter  and Florence Lawrence . Its interior scenes were
shot at Biograph's studio facilities in New York City,
and its exteriors were filmed on location in
Coytesville , today one of the oldest communities in
Fort Lee, New Jersey .[1]
Prints of this short survive, including in the film
archives of the Library of Congress .[4] Despite its title,
the motion picture is not an adaption of Jack London 's
1903 adve nture novel The Call of the Wild. Its content
is entirely unrelated to that literary work.[1]
The story , set in the late 1800s, is a cross-cultural
melodrama about Gladys Penrose (Florence
Lawrence ), a young white woman who rejects the
professed love of Geor ge Redfeather (Charles Inslee ).
Geor ge, a Native American , has lived for years in
white society and has just returned to the American
West from Pennsylvania,  where he graduated with high
honors and was a football star at a prominent "Indian
boarding school" in Carlisle. In recognit ion of Geor ge's
scholastic and athletic achievements, Gladys's father , a
lieutenant in the United States Army , holds a formal
reception and dance for the local "hero". Geor ge,
however , has fallen desperately in love with Gladys,
and at the party he openly expresses his feelings to her
as well as his desire to marry her one day. She angrily dismisses his advances, and her father , also
angered, orders the young man out of the Penrose house.
After leaving the party , Geor ge goes back to the small house in town where he living. Once back in his
bedroom—humiliated and infuriated by his treatment—he strips off his "white man's" formal evening
attire and dons traditional native buckskin clothing as well as an elaborate war bonnet . He then leaves the
town and rejoins his tribe "in the wilds" .[5] Back with his "own people", Geor ge agitates a small group of
his fellow braves  with a fiery speech and bottles of whiskey , and then, after becoming inebriated, hePlotPLAY film; runtime 00:14:09.returns by himself to the town to spy on Gladys and to observe her activities. When he sees her go riding
alone on horseback into the countryside, Geor ge assembles six of his braves, and they chase and capture
Gladys while she is gathering wildflowers. Geor ge now tries to force his affections on her as his men
watch and laugh in the background. Gladys struggles and rebuf fs him. She then points to the sky and
implores George to allow her to leave, reminding him not to abandon the teachings of God or to ignore
the constant "presence of the All Powerful Master".[5] Suddenly ashamed and contrite, Geor ge drops to
his knees. When he rises, he leads her back toward her horse, but the other braves attempt to stop her.
Geor ge pushes his men away , draws his knife, and threatens them if they do not allow her to go. The men
back off as he helps Gladys onto her horse. After he kisses her hand, she departs. He now finds her
handkerchief on the ground, presses it to his face, and exhibits remorse again for his actions. His men
appear to be disgusted by this change in his behavior . Geor ge rides off alone, still clutching Gladys's
handkerchief and visibly sad. After holding the handkerchief to his face one last time, he drops it to the
ground and leaves the scene.

The scene s inside Lieutenant Penrose's home and in Geor ge's bedroom were filmed at Biograph's New
York studio, which was situated in a large converted brownstone  residence at 11 East 14th Street  in
Manhattan.[6] All the outdoor scenes were shot on location about 12 miles from the studio, across the
Hudson River , in the community of Coytesville in Fort Lee, New Jersey .[1] Later , in 1915, in an
autobiographical feature for the movie fan magazine Photoplay , Florence  Lawrence  described working
on Biograph's "wild and woolly" screenplays in the borough:
...peaceful Coytesvi lle, New Jersey ...was the scene of most all the sensational western dramas
until abou t three years ago [1912], and this in spite of the fact that it was almo st impossible to
make a scene that even remotely resembled the west. There was always a telepho ne pole around
close enough to come within range of the camera which was never discovered until after the
scene was photographed.[7]
Filming at both the New York studio  and Coytesville were completed between September 17–25,
1908.[8][9] Eight days prior to the one-reeler's release, the production was copyrighted by Biograph and
assigned the registration number H117205.[1] That copyright protection expired long ago. Since this filmCast
ProductionActors Inslee (left) and Lawrence on
location in Coytesville, New Jersey,
September 1909was produced and publicly exhibited in the United States prior to 1929, it is now in the public domain  and
free for use without restrictions.
Biograph's selection of Florence Lawrence as a costar in the
production was not surprising at the time. She was in her second
year working in films, but during that relatively short time she had
gained considerable screen experience and was already one of the
more popular actors in Biograph's stock company of players.[10]
The year after the release of this short, studio executives and
theater audiences were referring to her as "The Biograph Girl",
and by 1910 Lawre nce was among the leading ladies in silent
films.[4]
The melodrama generally received very positive reviews in the days and weeks after its release in 1908.
In its October 31 issue that year, the New York-based trade journal  The Moving Pictur e World provides an
additional overview of the short's plot as well as a concise assessment of its presentation. "The film",
reports the journal, "is most thrilling in situations, beautiful in photography and superbly acted."[5]
Reviews in newspapers across the country were also positive. The Morning Astorian , for example, in
Astoria, Oregon , also summarizes the short's plot in its November 18 edition and then urges its readers to
see the film before its run at the local Grand Theatre ends:
The picture tells a story of a young Indian who gained fame as a hero in a college football
game. He comes in contact with a distinguished army officer who introduces the young buck to
his daughter . The Indian falls in love with the young lady and asks her to become his wife; she
refuses, he then becomes desperate and responds to "the call of the wild" where he rejoins his
own kind and seeks to for get his sorrow with over -indulgence in firewater .
The pictur e is intensely interesting and exciting throughout and is probably one of the best seen
in this city for some  time. Tonight will be the last opportunity to witness "The Call of the Wild"
and is well worth the time of anyone to pay the Grand a visit.[11]
The playable copy of the film featured on this page was produced from a 376-foot roll of paper prints
copied from the production's original footage. That roll of images, preserved in Library of Congress
(LOC), was made in 1908 by Biograph, which used its now-lost 35mm master negative of The Call of the
Wild to print frame-by-frame positive images of the drama onto strips of photographic paper .[9] Submitted
by Biograph to the United States government shortly before the film's release, the roll of paper prints is
part of the original documentation requi red by federal authorities when motion-p icture companies applied
for copyright  protection for their productions.[12] While the library's paper print record is not projectable,
such paper copies can be transferred onto modern polyester -based safety film stock  for screening. In fact,Release and r eception, 1908
Preservation statusduring the 1950s and early 1960s, Kemp R. Niver and other LOC staff restored more than 3,000 such
paper rolls in the library's collection and transferred many of them, including  The Call of the Wild, to
safety stock.[9]
