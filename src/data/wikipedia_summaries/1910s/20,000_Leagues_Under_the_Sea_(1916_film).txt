A strange "sea monster" has been rampaging the seas.
The United States sends the naval vessel Abraham
Lincoln  to investigate. During their search, the vessel
runs into the "monster ,” and it damages  their ship. The

technologically advanced submarine of Captain Nemo .

Nemo guides his submarine directly beneath the fourPlot

the sea during the attack. Nautilus  surfaces, and
Nemo's crew brings the four rescued  individuals aboard the submarine. The four include master
harpooner  Ned Land, a professor Pierre Aronnax, his daughter , and the professor's assistant. Once aboard
the subma rine, the four must swear they will not attempt to escape. The captain introduces them to his
vessel and the wonders of its underwater realm. He later takes them hunting on the seafloor .
Meanwhile, union soldiers in a runaway Union Army balloon  are marooned on a mysterious island. The
soldiers find a wild girl living alone. Soon the yacht of Charles  Denver arrives at the island. A woman 's
ghost (Prin cess Daak er) has haunted Denver, a former British colonial officer in India, whom he attacked
years ago. Rather than submit to him sexually , she had stabbed and killed herself. Denver then fled with
her young daughter only to abandon her on the island. Long tormented by his crime, he returned to find
the girl or determine what happened to her .
One soldier schemes to kidnap the child aboard Denver's yacht. Another hears of the plan and starts
swimming to the yacht to rescue her. Simultaneously , Nemo discovers the yacht belongs to Denver , the
enemy he has been seeking all these years. The Nautilus  destroys the yacht with a torpedo, but Captain
Nemo saves the girl and her rescuer .
In elabora te flashback scenes to India, Nemo reveals he is Prince Daaker and created the Nautilus to seek
revenge on Charles Denver . It overjoyed him to discover that the abandoned wild girl is his long-lost
daughter , but his emotion overcomes him, and he dies. His loyal crew buries him at the ocean bottom.
They disband and set the Nautilus  adrift. [6]

This was the first motion picture filmed underwater .[7] The underwater scenes were photographed by the
Williamson Submar ine Film Corporation in the Bahamas.[8] Actu al underwater cameras were not used,
but a system of watertight tubes and mirrors allowed the camera to shoot reflected images of underwater
scenes staged in shallow sunlit waters.[9] For the scene featuring a battle with an octopus,
cinematographer John Erne st William son devised a vewing chamber called the "photosphere", a 6×10-
foot steel globe in which a cameraman  could be placed. The chamber was connected to a boat by a
submarine tube from where Williamson would give his directions.[10][11]Cast

Williamson/Public DomainThe film was made by The Universal Film Manufacturing
Company  (now Universal Pictures ), not then known as a major
motion picture studio. Yet in 1916, they financed this film's
innovative special effects, location photography , large sets, exotic
costumes, sailing ships, and full-size navigable mock-up of the
surfaced submarine Nautilus .[12]
The film took two years to make, at the cost of $500,000.[8] Hal
Erickson has said that "the cost of this film was so astronomical
that it could not possibly post a profit, putting the kibosh on any
subsequent Verne adaptations for the next 12 years".[1]
