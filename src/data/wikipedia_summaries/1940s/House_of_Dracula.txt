House of Dracula
House of Dracula  is a 1945 American horror film
released and distributed by Universal Pictures .
Directed by Erle C. Kenton , the film features several
Universal Horror properties meeting as they had done
in the 1944 film House of Frankenstein . The film is set
at the castle home of Dr. Franz Edelmann, who is
visited first by Count Dracula  and later by Larry
Talbot, the Wolf Man, who are trying to cure their
vampirism and lycanthropy , respectiv ely. Talbot is
eventually cured, which leads him to discover the body
of Frankenstein's monster in a cave below the base of
the castle. Edelemann takes the monster's body back to
his laboratory but finds Count Dracula  has awakened
and by attacking his assistants, he captures Edelmann
and forces a revers e blood transfusion, which gives
Edelmann a split personality and makes him a killer .
The film was developed initially with the title Wolf
Man vs. Dracula  to be directed by Ford Beebe  with
Bela Lugosi  reprising his role of Count Dracula. After
actor Boris Karlof f returned for a two-film deal with
Universal and several requests from the censorship
board, the film was put on hold for nearly six months.
House of Dracula  went into production directed by
Kenton with a screenplay by Edward T. Lowe , who
took elements from the Wolf Man vs. Dracula  script
while adding in Frankenstein's monster  (from
Frankenstein ) to the plot. Many cast and crew
members returned from House of Frankenstein ,
including John Carradine  in the role of Count Dracula,
Glenn Strange  as the monster , and Lon Chaney Jr. as
both the Wolf Man and Larry Talbot. The film went
into production on September 17, 1945 , and finished
on Octobe r 24. The film uses large sections of music
from previ ous Unive rsal feature films and footage, sets
and props from other early Universal horror films. The
film was released on December 7, 1945. Historian
Gregory Mank described it as "the final serious entry
of Universal's Frankenstein  saga".[3] It recei vedDistributed by Universal Pictures

Count Dracula arrives at the castle  home of Dr. Franz
Edelmann and explains he has come to Visaria to find a cure for his vampirism . Dr. Edelmann agrees to
help, believing a series of blood transfusions may heal him. The doctor uses his own blood for the
transfusions. Afterw ards, the count has his coffin placed in the castle baseme nt. That night, Lawrence
Talbot  arriv es at the castle demanding to see Dr. Edelmann about a cure for his lycanthropy . Talbot is told
to wait, but knowing the moon is rising , has himself incarcerated by the police. Inspector Holtz asks the
doctor to see Talbot, and, as the full moon rises, they both witness his transformation into the Wolf Man.
Edelmann and his assistant Milizia have him transferred to the castle the next morning. The doctor tells
him he believes that moonlight does not trigger Talbot's transformations; it is pressure on the brain. He
believes he can relieve the pressure and asks Talbot to wait while he gathers more spores from a plant he
feels can cure him. Despondent at the thought of becoming the Wolf Man again, Talbot attempts suicide
by jumping into the ocean, only to end up in a cave below the castle.
Edelmann finds Talbot in the cave, where they come across the catatonic Frankenstein's mons ter, still
clutching the skeleton of Dr. Niemann . The humidity in the cave is perfect for propagating Clavaria
formosa , and a natural tunnel in the cave conne cts to a basement of the castle. Dr. Edelmann takes the
monster back to his lab, but considers reviving him to be too dangerous. Meanwhile, the count tries to
seduce Milizia and make her a vampire, but Milizia wards him off with a cross . The doctor interrupts to
explain he has found strange antibodies  in the count's blood, requiring another transfusion. Edelmann's
assistant Nina shadows Milizia and discovers that the count casts no reflection in a mirror . She warns
Edelmann of the vampire's danger to Milizia. The doctor prepares a transfus ion that will destroy the
vampire. During the procedure, the count uses his hypnotic powers to put Edelmann and Nina to sleep.
He reverse s the flow of the transfusion, sending his own blood into the doctor's veins. When they wake,
the count is carrying Milizia away . They revive Talbot and force the count away with a cross; Dracula
returns to his coffin as the sun is rising. Edelmann follows him and drags the open coffin into the
sunlight, destroying him.
The doctor begins reacting to Dracula's blood and finds he no longer casts a reflection in a mirror . Falling
unconscious, he sees strange visions of a monstrous version of himself performing unspeakable acts.
Edelmann awakens and tries to perform  the operation on Talbot. The doctor begins transforming into a
more monstrous personality and murders his gardener . When the townspeople discover the body , they
chase Edelmann, believing him to be Talbot. They follow him to the castle, where Holtz and Steinmuhl
interrogate Talbot and Edelmann. Steinm uhl is convinced the doctor is the murderer and assembles a mob
to execute him. The operation cures Talbot, but Edelmann again turns into his monstrous self. The doctor
revives Frankenstein's monster , with the others witnessing Edelmann's transformation. Edelmann breaks
Nina's neck and throws her body into the cave. Holtz and Steinmuhl lead the townspeople to the castle,Plotwhere the police attack the monster , but are subdued by the creature. The docto r kills Holtz by accidental
electrocution, and Talbot shoots Edelmann dead. Talbot starts a fire that traps the monster and the
townspeople flee the burning castle. The burning roof collapses on the monster .

The first news of a follow-up to House of Frankenstein  (1944) appeared in Hollywood trade papers in
April 1944 with the announcement of a film titled Wolf Man vs. Dracula , the scrip t of which differed
greatly from that for House of Dracula .[4] Bernard Schubert  was hired  to write the script and turned in his
first draft on May 19.[5] The film's director was to be Ford Beebe , who had worked on various horror
related projects, including directing the film serial The Phantom Creeps (1939) and the features Night
Monster  (1942) and The Invisible Man's Revenge  (1944), as well as producing Son of Dracula  (1943).[6]
Unknown to Beebe, actor Boris Karlof f had agreed to return to Universal Pictures  for a two-film deal,
which eventually became House of Frankenst ein and The Climax  (1944). This signin g put Wolf Man vs.
Dracula  on hold to focus on House of Frankenste in, which was to begin  shooting on April 4.[7] Schu bert
completed a final shooting script for Wolf Man vs. Drac ula dated November 30, 1944. The film's
producer Paul Malv ern had cuts made to it as ordered by Joseph Breen of the Motion Picture Producers
and Distri butors Association .[7] The script's second draft had only mino r variations, but the censors again
requested several more cuts, leading to the production's cancellation and the script being shelved for
nearly six months.[8] Following the release of House of Frankenstein , Malvern hired that film's
screenwriter , Edward T. Lowe , to rewor k the Wolf Man vs. Dracu la script. Lowe's scrip t, titled Destiny
and dated April 13, 1945, read much closer to the final film of House of Dracula  and now included
Frankenstein's monster .[9][8] By this point, Beebe had become busy with other film projects, so Erle C.
Kenton  took over as director .[8] Two days later, Lowe delivered the next treatment, which now included
new traits  such as Nina being made a hunchback .[10] Lowe rewrote the screenplay three more times,
borrowing elements from previous films, like the violent reaction to a cat from Werewolf of London .
During these re-writes, someone in production sent a memo to Lowe saying they "did not like the titleCast
Production
DevelopmentLionel Atwill in 1943. House
of Dracula would be among
his final feature films and
his fifth film in a Universal
Frankenstein film.Destiny  and it should be more like the previous  monster films - like House of Frankenstein  - how about
changing the name to House of Dracula ?"[11] Lowe was rewriting the script up to the eve of shooting the
film.[12]
House of Dracula  is a continuation of the film House of Frankenstein  and used much of that film's
crew .[4] Lowe is credited as the screenwriter . He based his screenplay on the uncredited story by Geor ge
Bricker  and Dwig ht V. Babcock.[6] Despite being a follow-up, the script does not explain the resurrection
of Count Dracula or the Wolf Man and moves Visaria's location to a cliff top on the seacoast.[6] Elements
of an earlier draft of a script dated September 20, 1945, features a scene where Edlemann examines a
seven-year -old boy whose leg he has healed.[13] Despite being cut, the finished film references this
scene.[13] Actor John Carradine  commented that around the time the film's script was finished, soldiers
were retur ning from  World War II. Many families were dealing with relatives suffering from the horrors
of war. This led to film studios "running scared from any type of horror film. The public now wanted
musicals and light fantasy . The horror and monster company on the lot was reduced to what could be
compared today as a weekly television soap opera or series".[14] In 1986, Carradine said Universal in the
1940s "was like a factory anyway and there was little room for creative talent when it stood in the way of
box office profits. The studio had little interest in making big budget pictures. It actually was very much
the counterpoint of the television industry [in 1986]".[15] Malvern echoed these statements in a later
interview , noting that in the 1940s, Universal's structure was set up as a "forer unner of the modern day
television production company".[16]
The film was annou nced initially with Bela Lugosi  repri sing his role as
Dracula.[4] When asked why Lugosi did not perform in either House of
Frankenstein  or House of Dracula , Malvern  said that "he probably was
working at a different studio [...] lots of actors were now free lance and
the Screen Actor's Guild had formed around 1937".[17] Film historian
Gregory William Mank said Lugosi was just completing work in Genius
at Work (1946) and would have had time to join the cast; he apparently
received no offer for the role.[18] Carradine  instead portrayed Dracula,
reprising his role from House of Frankenst ein.[4] Carradine  spoke about
playing Dracula in 1986: "I pity anyone who plays the part", adding "The
role holds a curse greater than Hamlet! Give the audience Richar d III,
Othello , The Merchant of Venice  and what will they remember? A
Vampyer!"[19] Carradine said his portrayal of Dracula was to be "as evil as
possible for I learne d long ago that if I wanted to continue to eat, villains
find steadier work than artists".[20] Carradine commented the script made
Dracula into "a type of dope fiend. Instead of existing as the traditional
vampire, he now was seeking out the help of a doctor to cure him of his vampir ism by the use of medical
means", adding "he knows he is doing something wrong, and yet he cannot stop himself. In Stoker's day
it was more sexual regression than drugs".[21] On gettin g an actor for the role of the Monster , Malvern
noted: "Lon was the Wolf Man, Lugos i was making pictures over at Monogram and Karlof f wouldn't
have played the monster again if it meant a million dollars".[22] Glenn Strange  portrayed the role of
Frankenstein's monster as he had done in House of Frankenst ein.[23] Lionel Atwill signed on to play
Inspector Holtz‚Äîhi s fifth appearance in a Universal Frankenstein film, after playing Inspector Krogh inPre-productionSon of Frankenstein  (1939), Dr. Boehme r in The Ghost of Franke nstein , the mayor in Frankenstein Meets
the Wolf Man and Inspector Arnz in House of Frankenstein . Atwill died of bronchial cancer  shortly after
filming House of Dracula .[12]
Martha O'Driscoll  portrayed the lead female role of Milil za Morelle, Dr Edelmann's nurse. Driscoll had
worked with Universal since 1937 in She's Danger ous.[23] A new character added to the Frankenstein
series in the film was Nina, the hunchb acked nurse, who was portrayed by Jane Adams.[3] Adams was a
former Conover model working in New  York City with a background in arts.[3][24] She met producer
Walter Wanger , who asked her to come to Hollywood for a screen test for Salome Wher e She Danced
(1945). She did not get the part but signed a contract with Universal.[24] Adams believed it was her size
that got her the role as Nina: "I'm only 5'3, and I think that's one reason I got into horror films, because
I'm not the chorus girl type; rather short  compared to the other girls who were under contract".[25] Adams
said she loved work ing at Universal and doing character parts, finding everyon e she worked with "very
congenial".[25] Many crew members on The House  of Frankenstein  returned for House of Dracula .[4][6]
These included executive producer Joseph Gershenson, director Erle C. Kenton, and screenwriter
Lowe.[6] Malvern said that he and Kenton "got along beautifully", adding "[h]e was one director who
thought everything out and made sure that he came in on budget and on time. He wasn't real fond of
directing the Abbott and Costello films so he got a kick out of the monster films".[26] The film's
cinematographer was Geor ge Robinson , who had previousl y worked on Univer sal's Son of Frankenstein ,
Frankenstein Meets  the Wolfman , House of Frankenst ein and the Spanish-language version of Dracula
(1931).[12]
The film began production on Septemb er 17, 1945.[4][27] A scene involving Glenn Strange rising from
quicksand holding the skeleton of Dr. Niemann from House of Frankenstein  was difficult for the actor ,
who recalled it was extremely cold. Strange said Chaney had offered him some alcohol which warmed
him up, and after shooting he rushed to his dressing room, which had a roaring fire. Following the
removal of his monster make-up, Strang e said he was "so looped I could hardly get up. I got warm and
then I got tight. But I think [Chaney] just about saved my life that day".[28]
According to Malvern, the budget for sets was $5,000. To save on lumber and nails for the war effort,
existing props and sets from films such as The Invisible Woman  and The Mummy's Hand  were reused.[29]
Several scenes from previous Universal  horror films were reused in House of Dracula ,[30] including the
dream sequence that lifts parts of Bride of Frankenstein  (1935); sequences from The Ghost of
Frankenstein 's fiery climax reappear in the burning of Edelmann's castle.[30] The film's score reuses
pieces from  Black Friday, Man-Made Monster , The Wolf Man, The Ghost  of Frankenstein , Frankenstein
Meets the Wolfman , House of Frankenst ein, The Scarl et Claw , and The Invisi ble Man's Revenge .[30]
Shooting of House of Dracula  finished on October 25.[31]
Prior to a public theatrical release, House of Dracula  was previewed at Universal on Nove mber 28,
1945.[32] The Universal Pictures Company distributed House of Dracula , which opened on December 7,
at the Rivoli Theatre in New York.[33][1] It was later shown at New York's Rialto Theatre on December
21.[32] At the film's screenings on the West Coast  of the United States, House of Dracula  was a doubleFilming

House of Dracula featuring
Onslow Stevens as Dr.
Franz Edelmann after the
blood transfusion with
Count Dracula.bill with The Daltons Ride Again  (1945), a western  also featuring
Chaney .[32][34] The 1946  National Box Office Digest Annual  placed House
of Dracula  earnings between $250,000 to $500,000 in 1945. It was not the
highest grossing film from Universal that year; that honor went to Lady on
a Train (1945), which grossed over $500,000. The film performed worse
financially than other horror films of the year, such as The Pictur e of
Dorian Gray (1945), but earned more than RKO's Isle of the Dead , The
Body Snatcher  and Zombies on Br oadway .[35]
MCA/Universal released House of Dracula  on VHS  in 1993.[36][37] The
film was released on DVD in 2004 in a set titled The Legacy Collection ,
which also included Dracula  (1931), the Spanish-language Dracula
(1931), Dracula's Daughter  (1936) and Son of Dracula .[38] The film was
released on Blu-ray  on May 16, 2017, as part of the Dracula: Complete
Legacy Collection  set.[39]
In contemporary reviews, Jack D. Grant of The Hollywood Reporter  reviewed the film at the Universal
preview , describing it as showing "the realms of pseudo-science interestingly invaded", adding, "the
squeamish proceedings [were] given steady pace under the knowing direction of Erle C. Kenton".[34][32]
Grant noted that "the greatest burden of acting is asked of Onslow Stevens [...] he performs his chores to
excellent effects".[32] "Brog." of Variety  also revie wed the November 28th screening, commenting that
the cast turn in "generally first rate work" that has "more or less become standard", and that "settings,
music, photography all contribute to necessary atmospheric mood".[40] Mank noted New York film critics
disliked the film.[32] Otis L. Guernsey Jr. of The New York Herald-T ribune  found that Universal was
"substituting quantit y for imagination", while Dorothy Masters of The New York Daily News  gave the
film a one and half star rating, proclaiming that it was "positively guaranteed not to scare the pants off of
anybody" and adding that "unfortunately , the film hasn't the capacity of being funny either , and is often
the case when synthetic horror becomes too rambunctious".[34] More negative reviews came from
Harrison's Reports , which found it "more ludicrous than terrifying" adding "much happens, but nothing
that will surprise anyone".[34] Only  a review in the New York World-T elegram  was posit ive, descri bing the
film as good fun.[32]
Outside of New York, The Motion Pictur e Herald  gave it a lukewarm review , which declared the "film
fulfills the requirements for a satisfactory horror picture",[34] while the Motion Pictur e Exhibitor  found
the film to have "plenty of suspense, dark dungeons and satisfactory performances by the entire cast".[34]
Reviewing the double feature with The Daltons Ride Again, Lowell E. Redelin gs of The Hollywood
Citizen-News  decla red that the film is "not high-budg et film fare, nor was it meant to be. Yet both films
are so nicely done that this new bill is corking good entertainment", adding "if all double bills were as
good as this one, there would be few complaints".[32][41]
In later critical analysis, Carlos Clarens  wrote about the Monster Rally  films in his book An Illustrated
History of the Horr or Film  (1967) summarizin g that "the sole charm of these films resides in the very
proficient contract players that populate d them, portraying gypsies, mad scien tists, lustful high priests,
vampire-killers, or mere red herrings".[42] John  Brosnan wrote in his book The Horror People  (1976) thatReceptionboth House of Dracula  and House of Frankenstein  were "interesting curiosities" and that House of
Dracula  was "the better of the two with plenty of gothic atmosphere and some impressive moments that
helped one ignore the absurd plot".[43] Bruc e Eder comme nted on a home video release of the film in
1994 finding that both were "great fun" but "curiously , House of Dracula  - which is padded with a lot of
footage from earlier films - is the more  interesting of the two", noting its more interesting premise and
that the "characterizations were interesti ng and the film makes excellent use of shadows".[44] Craig Butler
of the online film database AllMovie  found that while the film had an interesting premise, the idea was
not developed efficiently and that "coincidence runs rampant, further erasing the delicate 'believability'
line that is so difficult to maintain in supernatural flics". The review noted the film had "very little
horror", with one exception being the "marvelous sequence involving Dracula and his intended victim,
the latter seated at the piano and playin g 'Moonlight Sonata' as the good Count begins to work his spell
upon her".[45]
Mank describes House of Dracula  as "the final serious entry of Universa l's Frankenstein  saga".[3] On
November 28, 1945, Universal joined with British entrepreneur J. Arthur Rank , who bought one-fo urth
interest in the studio.[46] In 1946, Universal reported a profit of only $4.6 million. They responded by
dropping many actors from their contract roster .[41] On July 31, 1946, an official merger began. The
company , now called Universal‚ÄìIntern ational, had only Deanna Durbin , Abbott and Costello, Maria
Montez  and a few other actors remaining on their payroll.[46][41] House of Dracula  was the final time
make-up artist Jack Pierc e would create the make-up for the Wolf Man, Dracula and Frankenstein's
monster , as Universal released him in 1947.[47]
Chaney and Strange appeared in several  films and television series, including reprising the roles of Larry
Talbot and Frankenstein's monster in Universal-International's Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein
(1948).[48][47] Chaney appeared again as a werewolf in the Mexican production La Casa del Terror.[48]
Carradine reprised the role of Dracula on stage, television and in several low-budget feature films.[47]
