The Big Steal
The Big Steal  is a 1949 Americ an black-and-white
film noir reteaming Out of the Past stars Robert
Mitchum  and Jane Greer . The film was directed by
Don Siege l, based on the short story "The Road to
Carmichael's" by Richard Wormser .[4]
U.S. Army lieutenant Duke Halliday (Robert Mitchum )
is robbed of a $300,000 payroll by Jim Fiske (Patric
Knowles ). When Halliday's superior , Captain Vincent
Blake (William Bendix ), suspects  him of having taken
part in the theft, Halliday pursues Fiske into Mexico.
Along the way, he runs into Joan Graham (Jane Greer ),
who is also after Fiske, she for $2000  loaned to her
now ex-boyfriend. The two join forces , tentatively at
first, as they are not sure if they can trust each other .
Fiske stays one step ahead of the couple as they chase
him near the length of Mexico, pursued all the while
with equal ardour by Blake. When Halliday is knocked
down trying to stop Fiske from getting away , he comes
to the attention of Police Inspector General Ortega
(Ramon Novarro ). Halliday claims to be Blake, using
identification he took from the captain after a brawl.
Ortega lets him go after Fiske, but keeps an eye on
him. His suspicions  towards Halliday are confirmed
when the real Blake shows up at his office seeking
help.
Halliday and Graham ultimately track Fiske to a
safehouse in the desert, where a fence , Seton (John
Qualen ), offers him $150, 000 in untraceable bills in
exchange for the payroll. After a shootout, the couple
are captured by Seton's henchmen. When Blake shows
up, Halliday is initially relieved to be rescued, until
Blake reveals that he is actually the brains behind the
crime.PlotRelease date July 1, 1949 (US)[1]

Mitchum, 1949Fiske turns squeamish at the prospect of Graham being
murdered and dumped in the desert along with
Halliday , and proposes taking her with him. Blake,
who is calling all the shots, rejects the idea, and in an
act that shocks every one shoots Fiske in the back when
he goes to leave. Revealing just how ruthless he is, he
then calmly explains to the others that his cover story
will be that his late ex-partner , “apparently still at
large”, will take the blame for the missing payroll.
Seeking to twist Blake’ s confession back on him, Halliday then points out to Seton that if Blake gets rid
of him too, he can cover his tracks with the army by giving the stolen money  back to it and keep the
$150,000 for himself.
Alarmed, and taking no chances, Seton pulls a gun on everyone, and disarms Blake. Graham then creates
a distraction for Halliday to jump Blake, whom he bests in a bruising fistfight, while she accidentally
wounds Seaton during a successful struggle over his gun. Ortega is called to come make the arrests.
Cleared by Ortega of all wrongdoing, Halliday is free to return to the army . When he indicates to a
waiting Graham there is nothing to do in Mexico to keep him there any longer , she points his attention to
a passing Mexican couple parading their seven children. He gets her drift as she smiles coyly .

Robert Mitchum 's arrest for possession of marijuana  on September 1, 1948, and his subsequent
conviction and incarceration, had a large impact on the production of The Big Steal . RKO head Howard
Hughes  saw Mitchum's notoriety surrounding the arrest (the actor already seen as a 'bad boy' in
Hollywood) as a positive that would boost attention for a rather low-rent - but hopefully profitable -
production.
Geor ge Raft was originally cast, but was replaced by Mitchum after the arrest.[5] Lizabeth Scott  was
slated for the female  lead but quit three weeks prior to filming due to the arrest, and was replaced by Jane
Greer  (Mitchum and Gree r had been earlier paired in the successful 1947 noir Out of the Past). HughesCast
Production
Castinghad been keeping Greer, a former girlfriend, from appearing in any RKO films  in an attempt to ruin her
career , but finally conceded when no other actress would take the part.[6]
Filming (Los Angeles and Tehuacán, Puebla , Mexico) was rushe d in order to capitalize on the publicity
generated by Mitchum's drug charges and incarceration, with some scenes shot while Mitchum was
serving his sentence. Seigel commented upon the effect of Mitchum's absence upon a scene in which
William Bendix  pursues Mitchum through a forest, shot three months apart:
Mitchum in the picture would come running into a sequence and the trees would be green, and
Bendix would be right on his heels and the tree would be bare.[7]
Jane Greer's pregnancy ensured that the schedule was kept tight. This was part of the reason for the film's
relatively short 71 minute runtime.[8] Despite this Siegel said the film came in under budget.[2]
The screenwriters Gerald Drayson Adams  and Daniel Mainwaring  (nom de plume  Geof frey Homes), were
undecided as to Mitchum's film characterization, and according to film critic Judith M. Kass, viewers
may be “confused about Mitchum’ s motives until the final chase and denouement.”[7]
Capitalizing on Michum's headlines was a proven scheme for Hughes, who immediately following the
arrest had pushed for another of Mitchum's pictures, Rachel and the Stranger , to be released sooner than
planned. Rachel  was released on September 18, 1948, and became one of the year's biggest hits.[5]
The U.K. Region 2 DVD  from 2008 (in a box set with 8 other film noir thrillers) is a colourised version,
produced by Turner Entertainment , copyrighted 1991.
The U.S (multi regio n) DVD from 2007 is the black and white version and is on a double bill with 1955’ s
Illegal  (1955 film)  starring Edward G. Robinson .
Channel 4 film revie ws describes the movie as "Sparkling dialogues, fast-paced chases and the occasional
twist make this an at first somewhat confusing but ultimately hugely entertaining film."[9]
Hal Erickson writing for AllMovie  calls the film "tautly directed by Don Siegel, who manages to pack
plenty of twists and turns into the film's crowded 71 minutes."[10]Filming

Reception
Critical responseIn a review posted at Allmovie.com in 2024, Craig Butler writes:
“For a film noir, The Big Steal is surprisingly light. Unlike noirs such as The Big Sleep, which lace the
darker proceedings with plenty of humor , Steal is fairly amusing all the way through. The setup and the
stakes are serious, but the execution, even at its most action-packed, is handled with a sense of humor .
Those looking for typical noir existentialism will be disappointed, but most will find themselves drawn in
by Steal's charm…I f The Big Steal falls short of classic status, it's because it's ultimately a caper film
without a lot of depth to it; but if it's little more than one long chase, it's still an entertaining ride.” [11]Critic Judith M. Kass, writing in The Hollywood Professionals, Volume 4 (1976), singles out Jane Greer's
performance for special mention: “The real support for Mitchum comes from Greer , who is fast-talking,
quick-thinking and light on her feet as any masculine lead…”[12]
