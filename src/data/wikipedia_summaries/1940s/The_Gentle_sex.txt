The Gentle Sex
The Gent le Sex is a 1943 British  black-and-white
romantic comedy-drama war film, directed  by Leslie
Howard  and Maurice Elvey  and narrated by Howard. It
was produced  by Concanen Productio ns, Two Cities
Films , and Derrick de Marney .[2][1] It was Howard's
last film before his death.[3]
The documentary-drama follows seven women from
different backgroun ds who meet at an Auxiliary
Territorial Service  training camp. "Gentle" British
girls, they are now doing their bit to help out in World
War II: driving lorries and manning ack-ack  batteries.
Leslie Howard  provides slightly sarcastic narration
throughout the film.[4][5]
The girls are allowed to socialise at organised dances
with local male troops. Music is contemporary (big
band swing) and dancing includes the jitterbug .
Several of the girls find romance. The narrator points
out that "war is never kind to lovers".

Kinematograph Weekly  listed a series of films that were "runn ers up" in its survey of the most popular
films in Britain in 1943: The Gentle Sex, The Lamp Still Burns , Dear Octopus  and The Adventur es of
Tartu.[6]
The Monthly Film Bulletin  wrote: "The emotio nal content is sugg ested more often than fully exploited,
but it is so true and of such general appeal that the story holds the interest. It is a story which demands
considerable directorial ingeniousness – bringing together the threads of these seven lives, separating
them, reuniting them. By picking the girls out of a Victoria station crowd with camera and commentary
(spoken by himself), Howard has adroitly given each of them background depth almost before the film is
under way. ... The strength of the film, however , is the subtlety of its direction. A number of small details
rather than one obvious statement are preferred in making essential points of story , of character or of
background fact. Judicious mixing of sound and a wide variety of camera angles are used to enrich for theOther characters
Box office
Critical r eceptioninitiated and convey to the uninitiated the experiences of A.T.S. life. ... Remarkable also is the smooth
blending of the seven professional actresses with the reallife A.T.S. personnel with whom they train, drill,
work and live."[7]
The Radio Times Guide to Films  gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: "Viewed today , this drama seems
patronising in its depiction of the contribution made to the war effort by seven socially diverse women,
who volun teer for service on the same day. Yet it served its purpose both as a morale booster and as a
recruitment advertisement, thanks to some astute appeals to the patriotic spirit and some spunky acting by
a top-notch cast."[8]
In British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959  David Quinlan  rated the film as "very good",
writing: "A well-made film: the emotional content rings true, and the action scenes – the air raid, an all-
night lorry convoy – are vividly done."[9]
Leslie Halliwell  said: "Unassumin g war propaganda, quite pleasantly done and historica lly very
interesting."[10]
TV Guide  noted "some lucid and funny moments in a capable and intelligent production for its time."[11]Billy Mowbray wrote for Film 4, "if only social history was this good at school. Funny , fascinating and
probably unlike any film you've seen before, The Gentle Sex  is a bona fide cultural treasure."[12]
