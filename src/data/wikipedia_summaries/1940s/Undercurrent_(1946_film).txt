whom Alan had a relationship. Mrs. Foster , Alan's
neighbor , mentions Alan's brother Mich ael. When Ann
asks him about Michael, Alan tells her they became
estranged and lost contact. Ann gradually discovers
evidence of Michael's character contrary to Alan's
description; rather than a party animal and a thief,
Michael was a quiet and thoughtful man with an
appreciation of art. One of Michael's former friends
convinces Ann that Alan murdered Michael.
Ann visits Michael's former ranch house in California.
She encounters Michael, who pretends to be a

Cast notes:
Undercurrent  marked Robert Taylor 's screen return after spending three years in the Navy .[1]
Jayne Meadows  made her film debut in this film.[1]
"Rommy", the dog, was trained by Hollywood's most prestigious dog trainers, the Rudd
Weatherwax family .[3]
Under current was only director Vincente Minnelli 's second dramatic film, the first being The Clock ,
which starred his wife at the time, Judy Garland . Minnelli's specialty was in directing the kind of glossy
musicals that M-G-M's Arthur Freed unit turned out. Because he trusted producer Pandro S. Berman 'sCast
Productionjudgement in regard to the film's star, Katharine Hepburn – who had already signed on to do the film –
Minnelli accepted the assignment; Berman had produced Alice Adams  and Stage Door  with Hepburn
when they both worked for RKO Pictures . Berman and Minnelli would go on to make Madame Bovary
(1949), Father of the Bride  (1950), and other successful films together .[3]
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  paid David O. Selznick  $25,000[1] and RKO  $75,000[3] for the use of Robert
Mitchum . Mitchum  was working on two other films at the same time, Desir e Me (1947) and The Locket
(1946), which prom pted director Vincente Minnelli to wonder if that was how Mitchum maintained his
sleepy-eyed look.[3]
Hepburn was opinionated about her colleagues. She wasn't impressed by Mitchum, an opinion she did not
hide, and, at least at first, was not happy about Minnelli being the director of the film. Hepburn's self-
assurance made Minnelli nervous, but the two grew to be good friends, a fact which annoyed Robert
Taylor , who was afraid that the film would become a showcase for Hepburn. He changed his mind,
though, after realizing that Minnelli's direction was helping to improve his performance.[3]
The musical motif featured in the film is an excerpt from Johannes Brahms ' Symphony No. 3 .[1]
Variety  magazine lauded the film and wrote, "Under current is heavy drama with femme  appeal...Hepburn
sells her role with usual finesse and talent. Robert Mitchum, as the missing brother , has only three scenes,
but makes them count for importance."[7]
Critic Bosley Crowther  of The New York Times also liked the film and wrote, "However , that is
Under current-—and you must take it upon its own terms, which are those of theatrical dogmatism, if you
hope to endure it at all. If you do, you may find it gratifying principally because Miss Hepburn gives a
crisp and taut performance of a lady overcome by mounting fears and Mr. Taylor , back in films from his
war service, accelerates a brooding meanness as her spouse. You may also find Robert Mitchum fairly
appealing in a crum pled, modest way as the culturally oriented brother , even though he appears in only a
couple of scenes. And you may like Edmund Gwenn and Jayne Meadows, among others, in minor
roles."[8]
More recently , critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, "Director Vincente Minnelli...known mostly through his
upbeat MGM music als, changes direction with this tearjerker  femm e appealing romantic melodrama, that
can also be viewed as a heavy going psychological film noir (at least, stylishly noir through the brilliantly
dark photo graphy of Karl Freund)...Though overlong and filled with too many misleading clues about
which brother is the baddie, the acting is superb, even though both Katharine Hepburn and Robert
Mitchum are cast against type (a weak woman and a sensitive man). It successfully takes on the theme
from Gaslight ."[9]Reception
