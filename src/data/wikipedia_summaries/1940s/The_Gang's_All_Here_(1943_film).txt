The Gang's All Here (1943 film)
The Gang's All Here  is a 1943 American Twentieth
Century Fox Technicolor  musical film starring Alice
Faye , Carmen Miranda  and James Ellison . The film,
directed and choreographed by Busby Berkeley , is
known for its use of musical numbers with fruit hats.[2]
Included among the 10 highest-grossin g films of that
year, it was at that time Fox's most expensive
production.[3]
Musical highlights include Carmen Miranda
performing an insinuating, witty version of "You
Discover You're in New York" that lampoons fads,
fashions, and wartime shortages of the time. The film
features Miranda's "The Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat"
which, because of its sexual innuendo (dozens of
scantily clad women handling very large bananas),
apparently prevented the film from being shown in
Brazil on its initial release.[4][5] In the US, the censors
dictated that the chorus girls must hold the bananas at
the waist and not at the hip. Alice Faye sings "A
Journey to a Star," "No Love, No Nothin'," and the
surreal finale "The Polka-Dot Polka."
The film was nominated for an Academy Award  for
Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration,  Color  (James
Basevi , Joseph C. Wright , Thomas Little ).[6] It was the
last musical Faye made as a Hollywood superstar . She
was pregnant with her second daughter during
filming.[7] In 2014, The Gang's All Here was deemed
"culturally , historica lly, or aesthetically significant" by
the Library of Congress  and selected for preservation
in the National Film Registry .[8][9]
A man sings "Brazil " as the opening credits fade to the
disembarkation of a ship, SS Brazil. As the exotic
goods are netted off the ship the camera pans down to
the archetypal exotic fruit hat on Carmen Miranda  who
reprises the song.PlotEdited by Ray Curtiss

takes his nervous partner , Peyton Potter , to the Club
New Yorker for a celebratory evening with his son,
Sgt. Andre w J. Mason Jr., who is abou t to report for
active duty in the Army . A. J. and Andy enjoy the
show , which features master of ceremonies Phil Baker
and dancer Tony De Marco, while Potter worries about
what his wife Bloss om would say if she knew he was
there. While Potter is trapped into dancing with
Brazilian sensation Dorita, Andy becomes intrigued by
entertainer Eadie Allen. Phil warns Andy that because
Eadie dances at the Broadway Canteen between shows,
she will not go out on a date with him, but Andy follows her to the canteen and tells her that his name is
Sgt. Pat Casey so that she will not be intimidated by his wealth. Despite her insistence that she cannot
date servic emen outside the canteen, Eadie is charmed by Andy and agrees to meet him later when he
pursues her to the nightclub. Eadie and Andy spend the evening talking and falling in love, and the next
day, Eadie bids him farewell at the train station and promises to write every day .
Andy distinguishes himself in battle in the South Pacific, and is granted a furlough after being awarded a
medal. A. J. is thrill ed and plans to throw a welcome home party for Andy at the Club New Yorker . Phil
cannot accommodate his plans, however , as the club is closed for two weeks while the company rehearses
a new show . Munificent as always, A. J. invites the performers to rehearse at his and Potter's homes,
where they can throw a lavish garden party and war bond rally to welcome Andy . Potter is perturbed
about the arrangements when he learns that Blossom knows Phil from her former days as an entertainer ,
and his chagrin grows when Tony's partner cannot perform and he asks Potter's daughter Vivian to dance
with him. Hoping to persuade the stodg y Potter to allow Vivian to perform, Blossom tells him that Phil
has threatened to reveal her wild past if Vivian is not in the show . Potter acquiesces, but his problems
grow when he is pursued by the roman tic-minded Dorita. When not chasing Potter , Dorita learns that
Vivian has a boyfriend named Andy , and that he and Eadie's "Casey" are the same man.
Complications arise  as Dorita tries to keep Vivian and Eadie from discovering  Andy's deception. When
Andy and the real Pat Casey arrive at the house, however , Eadie learns the truth. Andy proclaims that he
wants to marry her and not Vivian, but Eadie insists on breaking off their relatio nship, as she believes that
Vivian really cares for him. During the show , however , Vivian tells Eadie that she is going to Broadway
to perform as Tony's permanent partner , and reveals that she and Andy were never truly in love. As the
show comes to a close, Eadie and Andy reconcile, and everyone joins in the final song.[10]

The working title of this film was The Girls He Left Behind .
According to a January 7, 1943 news item, composer Harry
Warren  was originally scheduled to work with lyricist Mack
Gordon  on the film's score,  but Warren instead wrote the picture's
songs with Leo Robin . A news in The Hollywood Reporter  on 30
March 1943 included "Pickin' on Your Momma" in the list of
songs to be feature d in the film. Modern sources note that the
song, along with "Sleepy Moon" and "Drums and Dreams" were
cut before the final release. According to The Hollywood Reporter
and a studio press release, Linda Darnell  was originally scheduled
to play "Vivian Potter," which would have been her first dancing
role in motion pictures. During dance rehearsals, however , Darnell
sprained her ankle, and after her recovery , eloped with
cinematographer Peverell Marley  and asked Twentieth Century-
Fox for an indefinite leave of absence. Darnell was replaced in the
role by Sheila R yan.
The Gang's All Here began production in April 1943. Berkeley learned that Darryl F. Zanuck  would not
be oversee ing the production. Fox's studio head was in Europe on behalf of the war effort, leaving the
chore to William LeBaron , a producer and songwriter who had worked at other studios before coming to
Fox. Under Zanuck, he set up an independent unit at the studio, mostly making musicals. He and
Berkeley got along well at first, but the relationship soon was strained as the showman in Berkeley would
not yield to the budget-trimming mandates of LeBaron (who, in turn, was forced to trim expenses due to
the demands of the War Production Board, which sought cost cutting in all aspects of businesses duringProductionMiranda became known for the
signature fruit hat outfit she wore in
her American films, especially in
The Gang's All Here.the war). In spite of the producer/director discord during shooting,
the film turned out to be an outrageous ly conceived work of art,
blending with subtlety the politics of alliances while overtly
disarming the viewing public with surrealism and spectacle.[11]
Although Alice Faye  did have a singing  cameo in the 1944 film
Four Jills in a Jeep, this pictu re marke d her last appearanc e in a
musical film until State Fair (1962). Faye, who was pregnant with
her second child during filming of The Gang's All Here, retired
from the screen and only made one film in the intervening period,
the drama Fallen Angel  (1945). The Gang's All Here marked the
screen debuts of actresses June Haver  (1926–2005), Jeanne Crain
(1925–2003) and Jo-Carroll Dennison , who was Miss America  of
1942. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times, the film
was to include a parody of Phil Baker's radio show Take It or Leave It. The sequence was cut, and Baker
instead made an entire film based on the show , called Take It or Leave It , for Twentieth Century-Fox.
The Gang's All Here was the first color film entirely directe d by Berkeley (he had earlier directed dance
numbers for the 1930 two-color Technicolor  film Whoopee! ), and the extravagant production numbers
were well received. While praising Berkeley's work, the MPH reviewer commented that the production
numbers "are opulent in highly effective color combinations and are climaxed by a finale in the cubistic
and modernistic tempo which is different from anything that has passed this reviewer's way since some of
the abstract treatments employed by Walt Disney's Fantasia ." Although some modern sources indicate
that the film was banned in Brazil  because of the giant bananas featured in "The Lady with Tutti-Frutti
Hat" number , the film's file in the Motion Picture Production Code Colle ction  at the AMP AS Library
contained no information about censorship in Brazil and the film was appro ved for export to South
American countries.  The picture receiv ed an Academy Award nomination in the Art Direction (Color)
category .[12]

The film was releas ed on December 24, 1943.[15] The Gang's All Here it became one of the 25 top-
grossing films  of 1943–44.[16]
Most of the reviewers were positive with the exception of the critic for The New York Times, who
observed a Freudian  slant to Berkeley's giant bananas: "But in the main, The Gang's All Here is a series
of lengthy and lavis h production numbers all arranged by Busby Berkeley as if money was no object but
titillation was. Mr. Berkeley has some sly notions under his busby . One or two of his dance spectacles
seem to stem straig ht from Freud  and, if interpreted, might bring a rosy blush to several cheeks in the
Hays of fice."[17]
Philip French wrote in the London  Observer : "The movie provid es an escape from wartime anxieties and
austerities into an extravagant, fantastical world, most spectacularly in what James Agee called Berkeley's
'paroxysmic product ion numbers' involving Miranda'."[18] James Agee, said about the movie: "There is
one routin e with giant papier -mache bananas, cutting to thighs, then feet, then rows of toes, which
deserves to survive in every casebook of blatant film surreptition for the next century ."[19]
The MPH  reviewer  comment ed that the production numbers "are opulent in highly effective color
combinations and are climaxed by a finale in the cubistic and modernistic tempo which is different from
anything that has passed this reviewer's way since some of the abstract treatments employed by Walt
Disney's Fantasia ." Wanda Hale of the New York Daily News  wrote: "It's colossal, it's stupendous, and
one of the artiest productions ever made... It is a Technicolor dream that takes on nightmarish proportions
or the aspects of a Dali drawing in motion."[20] "Whatever this film is, exactly , it is worth seeing", wrote
Michael Phillips of the Chicago T ribune .
"Busby Berkeley's most audacious film—an exploration of the possibilities of movement and color that
moves into the realm of pure abstractio n. The sexual symbolism is at its most blatant, what can you say
about a film that features 60 girls waving gigantic bananas?" wrote critic Don Druker for the newspaper
Chicago Reader .[21]Release
Critical r eception"Busby Berkeley's first in colour , reaching some sort of apotheosis in vulgarity with Carmen Miranda's
'Lady in the Tutti-F rutti Hat' accompanied by a parade of chorines manipulating outsize bananas,"
highlighted the magazine Time Out .[22]
"A weak script is somewhat relegated by the flock of tuneful musical numbers  that frequently punctuate
the picture," said Variety .[23]
16th Academy Awards  (1944)

The Gang's All Here first appe ared on LaserDisc  in 1997 from 20th Cent ury Fox Home Entertainment .
Fox first released the film on DVD in 2007 as part of The Alice Faye Collection , but the transfer was
criticized for its faded color reproduction subduing the original vibrant Technicolor hues.[27] It was
rereleased on DVD in 2008 as part of Fox's The Carmen Miranda Collection ; this edition contained a
brighter and more colorful transfer .[28]
In 2014, Eureka Entertainment in the UK released the film on a region B Blu-ray as part of their Masters
of Cinema  series. This edition preserved the vibrant color scheme. In 2016, Twilight Time in the US
released a region 0, limited edition Blu-ray of 3,000 units. Though also fully restored, it utilized a much
duller , darker transfer than the Eureka.
