The Rose (film)
The Rose  is a 1979 American musical  drama film
directed by Mark Rydell , and starring Bette Midler,
Alan Bates , Frederic Forrest , Harry Dean Stanto n,
Barry Primus , and David Keith . Loosely based on the
life of Janis Joplin , the film follows a self-destructive
rock star in the late 1960s, who struggles to cope with
the pressu res of her career and the demands of her
ruthless business manager .
Originally titled Pearl  (Janis Joplin's nickname and the
title of her last album ), the film's screenplay was
revised and fictionalized after the Joplin family
declined to allow producers the rights to her story .[6]
The Rose  was nominated for four Academy Awards  at
the 52nd Academy Awards  (1980), including Best
Actress in a Leading Role  (Bette Midler , in her screen
debut), Best Actor in a Supporting Role  (Frederic
Forrest), Best Film Editing  and Best Sound .[7] Midler
performed the soundtrack album  for the film, and its
title track  became one of her biggest hit singles.
In late 1969, Mary Rose Foster is a famous rock and
roll diva known as "The Rose." In spite of her success,
her personal life is lonely and exhausting. She is
exploited and overworked by her gruff, greedy
manager and promoter Rudge Campbell. Though
forthright and brassy , Rose is an insecure alcoholic  and
former drug user who seems to crave approval in her
life. As such, she is determined to return to her Florida
hometown, now as a superstar , and perform for the
people from her past.
Following a performance in Texas, Rose meets with
country music  star Billy Ray, whom she idolizes and
whose songs she often covers in live shows. Billy Ray
cruelly demands that she never perfo rm his music
again and rudely dismisses her. After discovering that
Rudge arranged the meeting because he wants to signPlotRunning time 134 minutes[2]

(US/Canada)[5]Billy Ray to his label , Rose defiantly flees with a
limousine driver named Huston Dyer . The two take a
cross-country trip to New York City, where Rose is
scheduled to complete recording sessions. They begin
a whirlwind romance.
Rudge assumes that Huston is just another hanger -on,
but Rose feels she has finally met her true love. Huston
eventually admits to her that he is actually an AWOL  sergeant from the Army , and she tells him of her
past in Florida. The couple's relationship grows turbulent amidst Rose's reckless lifestyle and constant
touring. In Memphis , Rose is met by Sarah, a former lover of hers. When Huston walks in on the two
women kissing, he and Rose get into a violent fight, after which Huston flees.
Determined to reunite with Huston, Rose searches for him in a red light district  of Memphis with PFC
Mal, a military member whom she met in Texas. She subsequently appoints Mal as her security escort,
and the two travel to Rose's hometown Jacksonville , where Rudge has booked her a homet own reunion
show . Upon arriving , Rose shows Mal her childhood home, her high school and other local landmarks
from her childhood. Arriving at the stadium for afternoon rehearsals, Rose repeats her intention to take a
one-year break from performing, leading Rudge to tell her she will be in breach of contract . Rudge
proceeds to fire her, though unbeknownst to Rose, this is only a ploy to ensure that she performs the
show . A distraught Rose is met by Huston, who has traveled to Jacksonville to reunite with her .
Believing her concert is cancelled, Rose  decides to run away and start a new life with Huston. That night,
she takes Huston on a tour of local bars and clubs she used to frequent prior to becoming famous,
recklessly drinking and indulging in barbiturates  and heroin . At one bar, Huston becomes jealous when a
male patron harasses Rose as she perfor ms, and he begins a fight. After , Rudge reaches Rose on her car
phone  and convinces her to return for the concert. She acquiesces, and her decision to appease Rudge
causes Huston to give up on the relationship and leave town. Later that night, after performing the
opening song of her long-awaited homecoming concert, Rose collapses onstage and dies of an overdose.
The movie ends with a closing scene of Rose's parents and Mal at a garage, following a member of the
press who is following Rose's tragic death. After taking pictures from Rose as a kid, and some clips she
gathered from Billy Ray, Mal turns the lights off as they leave and the garage, along with Rose's
memories and photographs, goes dark.
