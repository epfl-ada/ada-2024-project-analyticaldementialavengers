The Irony of Fate
The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath! ,[a] usually
shortened to The Irony of Fate , is a 1976 Soviet
romantic comedy  television film directed by Eldar
Ryazanov  and starring Andrey Myagkov , Barbara
Brylska , Yury Yakovlev  and Lyubov Dobrzhansk aya.
The scree nplay was written by Emil Brag insky  and
Ryazanov , loosely based on the direct or's 1971 play,
Once on New Year's Eve (Russian : Однажды в
новогоднюю но чь).
Filmed at the Mosfilm  Studios, The Irony of Fate
doubles as a screwball comedy  and a love story tinged
with sadne ss. It was one of the most successful Soviet
television productio ns and remains a highly popular
New Year's Eve classic in Russia  and the post-Soviet
states , with millions tuning in to rewatch it every New
Year's Eve.
The key subplot is the drab uniformity of Brezhnev-era
public architecture.  This setting is explained in a
humorous animated  prologue (directed and animated
by cartoon ist Vitaly Peskov) in which architects are
overruled by politicians and red tape. As a result, the
identical, functional but unimaginative multistory
apartment buildings  found their way into every city,
town, and suburb across the Soviet Union.[1]
Following their annual tradition, a group of friends
meet at a banya  (a traditional public "sauna"
bathhouse) in Moscow  to celebr ate New Year's Eve.
The friends all get very drunk toasting the upcoming
marriage of the central male character , Zhenya
Lukashin (Andrey Myagkov ) to Galya (Olga
Naumenko ). After the bath, one of the friends, Pavlik
(Aleksandr Shirvindt ), has to catch a flight to
Leningrad  and the entire group is going to take him to
the airport. By the time the group makes it to thePlotProduction companyMosfilm

remaining friends cannot remember which person from
their group is supposed to travel. They mistakenly get
Zhenya onto the plane instead of Pavlik.
Zhenya spends the entire flight sleeping on the
shoulder of his annoyed seatmate (Eldar Ryazanov in a
brief comedic cameo appearance ). The seatmate helps
Zhenya get off the plane in Leningrad. Zhenya wakes
up in the Leningrad airport, believing he is still in Moscow . He stumbles into a taxi and, still quite drunk,
gives the driver his address. It turns out that in Leningrad there is an identical address that belongs to an
apartment buildings of a design identical to Zhenya's building in Moscow . He takes the elevator to "his"
apartment and, surprisingly , the key fits in the door (as alluded to in the introductory narration,
"...building standard  apartments with standard locks"). Inside, even the furniture is nearly identical to that
of Zhenya's apartment, but Zhenya is too drunk to notice any minor dif ferences.
Meanwhile, the apartment's resident, Nadya Shevelyova (Barbara Brylska ), comes home and finds
Zhenya asleep on her bed. To make matters worse, Nadya's fiancé, Ippolit (Yuri Yakovlev ), shows up
without an advance notice. Ippolit becom es furious, refuses to believe Zhenya and Nadya's explanations,
and storms out. Zhenya is about to leave to get back to Moscow but circumstances make him return
repeatedly . Nadya wants to get rid of Zhenya as soon as possible, but there are no flights to Moscow until
the next morning. Additionally , Zhenya  tries repeatedly to call Moscow and explain to Galya what has
happened. Eventuall y, he does contact Galya, but she is furious and hangs up on his call. Ippolit also calls
Nadya's apartment and hears Zhenya answer . Although Zhenya is trying to be available to receive
potential calls from Galya, Ippolit also refuses to accept the truth of the situation. Nadya goes to the
railway station and buys a train ticket to Moscow for Zhenya, but he abruptly  rips it up and refuses to
leave. It seems more and more clear that Zhenya and Nadya are the only two people who understand the
night's circumstances.
Thus, Zhenya and Nadya are compelled  to spend New Year's Eve together . At first, they continue to treat
each other with animosity , but gradually  their behavior softens, and the two fall in love. In the morning, a
drunken Ippolit barges into the apartme nt and amazes Zhenya and Nadia with his erratic behavior (he
takes a shower right in his winter coat and hat) and at the same time logic al and close to the truth
arguments about what happened on this New Year's Eve. Ippolit, wet "with tears", leaves Nadia for good.
The duo feel that everything that has happened to them was a delusion, and they make the difficult
decision to part. With a heavy heart, Zhenya returns to Moscow . Meanw hile, Nadya reconsiders
everything and, deciding that she might have let her chance at happiness slip away , takes a plane to
Moscow to find Zhenya. She has no difficulty finding him as their addresses are the same, and her key
matches his lock.

After reading the script, composer Mikael Tariverdiev
was puzzled by its genre diversity . As a result, he
defined it for himsel f as a Christmas fairy tale, and for
musical accompaniment he chose eight romances  –
"about love, about happiness, about jealousy , about
kindness, about the desire to be understood" – which at
first sound like a sharp counterpoint to what is
happening on the screen, but then "scissors between
the sound and the picture conver ged".[2]
The soundtrack for The Irony of Fate was partly released on Mikael Tariverdiev 's LP in 1976 by
Melodiya .[3] A full soundtrack was released in 2009 by Bomba Music (Russia)[4] and in 2016 by Earth
(UK).[5]
Male voca ls are mostly performed by Sergey Nikitin, female vocals – by Alla Puga cheva . Initially , Anna
German  was preparing to perform songs for the film, but the recording did not take place – the funds for
the invitation of a foreign singer were not included in the estimate.[6]

The two consecutiv e episodes of The Irony of Fate were originally broadcast by the Soviet central
television channel, Programme One,[7] on 1 January 1976, at 18:00.[8] The film was a resounding success
with audiences: author Fedor Razzakov recalled that "virtually the entire country watched the show";[9]
the number of viewers was estimated  to have been about 100 million.[10] In response to popular demand,
the feature had a first re-run on 7 February . By 1978, after several further broadcasts of the picture, the
accumulated number of viewers for all of the showings including the first was estimated at 250 million.[9]
A shortened 155 minute version was released to cinemas on 16 August 1976;[11] which sold 7 million
tickets.[12] The readers of Sovetskii Ekran , the official publication of the State Committee for
Cinematography , voted The Irony of Fate as the best film of 1976, and chose Andrey Myagkov  as the best
actor of the year.[13] In 1977, Ryazanov , Braginsky , cinem atographer Vladimir Nakhabtse v, compose r
Mikael Tariverdiev  and actors Barbara Brylska  and Myagkov were  all awarded the USSR State Prize  in
recognition of their participation in making the film.[11]
Geor ge Faraday commented that while it was basically a happy ending romantic comedy , The Irony of
Fate had a "socially critical undertone." It could be interpreted as an "explicit commentary ... On the
soulless uniformity of the Soviet urban landscape".[14] Simultan eously , however , critics accused the
director of creating an escapist film which allowed the Soviet audience to turn away from the
"unattractive feature s" of their country's reality . In a 1977 issue of Sovetskii Ekran, Ryazano v responded
that "to reassure, to encourage the viewer – it is not such a sin." He rejected the claims his pictures were
meant to please state authorities, stating their optimistic nature was "spontaneous" rather than
"forced".[15]
In his book Problems in the Russian House ,[b] Sergey Kara-Murza  posted a critical article in which he
reproached Ryazanov for the "anti-Sovietism " nature of his heroes, as well as for the formation and
cultivation of images of "internal emigr ants" by him. In his opinion, the heroe s of the film are "typical
intelligents  of those years with social traits close to this circle," who, however , are well over thirty but
they do not have a family and children, while having energetic mothers [almost implausible for a post-
war generation] who care about their comfort and material well-being. The subtle signs of the "far-
fetched elitism, aristocracy" of the film's characters were picked up and assimilated by a very significant
part of the intelligentsia , who eventually "enthusiastically accepted Perestroika  and applauded
Sakharov ".[16]ReceptionIn 2019, archdeacon  Vladimir Vasilik analyzed several themes of the film – orphanhood and
fatherlessness of the Soviet intelligentsia of the Khrushchev-Brezhnev era, love and betrayal,
drunkenness, blizza rd as an image of Fate and a metaphor of infernal fun for the New Year, – and
described the film as "a monument to the era of late socialism with all its greatne ss and tragedy ," which at
the same time "carri es the reflection of the love fading on earth from people who have experienced God-
abandonment." Longing for God is transmitted primarily "in songs and poems that serve as a chorus in
ancient tragedy ."[17]
The film is widely regarded as a classic piece of Russian popular culture and is traditionally broadcast in
Russia and almost all former Soviet republics every New Year's Eve (Andrew Horton and Michael
Brashinsky likened its status to that held by Frank Capra's 1946 It's a Wonderful Life in the United States
as a holiday staple).[18] The soundtrack of the film was also highly appreciated and places among the
most famous and recognizable music  of an era in post-Soviet countries.[19] This tradition was
discontinued in Ukraine  in 2015 when licence holder STB decided not to broadcast the movie after the
actress Valentina Talyzina  was bann ed from entering Ukraine for "statements contradicting the interests
of our national security".[20][21]
In 2006, The New Year's Eve musical film "The First Fast", shown on Channel One, included a mini-
sequel to "The Irony of Fate". Ippolit and Nadia meet after 30 years. During the heartful conversation, it
turns out that Zhen ya and Nadia broke up quite quickly and Ippolit is still not married. To Nadia's
question, "Why?" he answers: "I've been waiting for you. And I keep waiting." Nadia doesn't know what
to answer and whisp ers "Don't be sad". Ippolit remains alone. Gleb Kolondo (Vatnikstan) considered: "It
seemed to be better than Bekmambetov's [film]  two years later".[22]
A sequel, The Irony of Fate 2, was released in December 2007, becoming a box office hit and grossing
over $55 million to a production budget of $5 million.
The film starred Konstantin Khabensky  and Elizaveta Boyarskaya  as the grown-up children of Lukashin
and Sheveleva who have managed to get into the same situation as their parents did.
Andrey Myagkov , although he took part in the filming, eventually expressed his regret and dissatisfaction
with the final result.[23]
In 2015, an Indian remake  of the film I Love NY was relea sed, starring actors Sunny Deol  and Kangana
Ranaut . The film performed poorly critically and was a box of fice flop.Legacy
Sequel
RemakesIn 2022, an American remake  of the film About Fate was released. It was directed by Maryus Vaysber g
and starred Emma Roberts  and Thomas Mann  in the lead roles.[24]
