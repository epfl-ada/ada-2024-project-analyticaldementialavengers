Up from the Depths
Up From the Depth s is a 1979 horror film directed by
Charles B. Griffith and starring Sam Bottoms , Susanne
Reed, Virgil Frye, Kedric Wolfe, and Charles
Howerton . The film, along with many other natural
horror films at the time of its release, was made due to
the success of Jaws .
The staff and vacationers at a first-class resort on the
island of Maui  are beginning to mysteriously
disappear . A biologist  believes that an underwater
earthquake  has caused a giant and very hungry
dormant prehistoric fish to be released from its
slumber . The fish voraciously helps itself to a tourist
buffet. Now it is open season for the local fishermen to
find and kill the creature.

Charles B Griffith later called making the film a
"terrible experience".
We had it written by one of the typists or
secretaries in the office who didn't have
any thoug hts of becoming a writer . I think
Roger  did it to punish me, to send me out
to The Philippines where I didn't know
what I was getting into. I was making anPlot

Language Englishaction picture, but The Philippines people
were all so depressed, and they had made
this goofy -looking fish with bug eyes. I
told them that we'll make it a comedy , and
their eyes lit up! So I sent back a comedy
on one plane, and I arrived on the next
one. By the time I arrived, Roger had
already cut 75 minutes out. As an editor
would say, "That's a set-up, that's a
payof f!"[1]
Up from the Depths  was relea sed on DVD  by Shout Factory  as a part of its "Roger Corman's Cult
Classics" on January 18, 201 1. Shout Factory later re-released the film on October 9, 2012.[2]
Kurt Dahl ke from DVD Talk gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, criticizing the film's corny acting, uneven
tone, and obvious rubber monster suit. Dahlke concluded his review by writing, "Up From The Depths
isn't remotely scary or thrilling, it lacks sufficient violence or gore to please the punters, and its mid-
course switch to comedy isn't all that funny either . We're talking about a real heap of bronze-plated crud,
so if your taste runs to Z-movies, you'll still probably have to get real drunk to eke any pleasure out of
this one."[3] Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic  gave the film 1/5 stars, panning the film's lack of
characterizations, and suspense, as well as the film's special effects, and poor dubbing.[4] R.L. Shafer
from IGN called the film "severely lacking", and "a low-rent knock-of f of Steven Spielber g's smash-hit,
Jaws ".[5]
