Meet **Ethan Blackwood**, a 28-year-old former Army medic turned private investigator.

**Background**: Ethan grew up in a small town in England, where his parents owned a pub. He was always drawn to adventure and mystery, which led him to join the British Army at a young age. After serving for six years, he left with a few physical scars and a deep respect for human life. He then turned his skills towards private investigation, using his expertise in surveillance and interrogation to help people in need.

**Physical Appearance**: Ethan stands at 6'1" with an athletic build, honed from years of military service. His short, dark brown hair is often messy, and his bright blue eyes seem to bore into those he interrogates. He has a scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a mission gone wrong.

**Occupation**: Ethan runs his own private investigation agency, "Blackwood & Co." From his modest office in the city, he takes on cases that intrigue him, often involving missing persons, corporate espionage, or high-stakes smuggling operations. His reputation for being fiercely independent and unafraid to take risks has earned him a loyal client base.

**Personality**: Ethan is a complex individual with a dry sense of humor and a sharp mind. He's fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. His background in medicine has taught him the importance of empathy, but his years as an Army medic have also made him wary of emotional attachments. As a result, he keeps people at arm's length, often appearing aloof or standoffish to those who don't know him.

**Daily Life**: Ethan's days are filled with research, surveillance, and interviews. He spends long hours pouring over case files, looking for clues that might lead him to the next break in the investigation. When he's not working, he enjoys hiking in the countryside and playing guitar. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for stray animals and often finds himself taking in homeless cats or dogs.

**Combining characteristics**: By combining elements from Teddy (mysterious), Price (ruthless), Gander (resourceful), Richard (impulsive), Julia (involvement with the plot), and Dr. Sterling (enigmatic figure), Ethan Blackwood becomes a unique individual:

* He has a mysterious past, having left the Army without explanation.
* His occupation as a private investigator draws him into high-stakes smuggling operations, similar to Price's involvement.
* Ethan is resourceful and clever, often using his medical skills to gather information or defuse tense situations (similar to Gander).
* He has a strong sense of justice, which drives him to take risks and confront danger head-on (like Richard).
* Julia's association with the plot might make her an occasional ally or adversary for Ethan.
* Dr. Sterling's enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern his true motivations or allegiances, adding an air of mystery to their interactions.

Ethan Blackwood is a complex, dynamic character with a rich backstory and nuanced personality. His skills and experience make him a formidable private investigator, but also leave room for growth and self-discovery in the future.
