**Name:** Aurélien "Ren" Dumont

**Age:** 28

**Background:** Born into a lower-middle-class family in a small town in France, Ren grew up surrounded by the struggles of his parents and their friends. His father was a factory worker who struggled to make ends meet, while his mother worked as a waitress to support the family. Despite these challenges, Ren's parents encouraged him to pursue his passions, which led him to study engineering and eventually land a job at a prestigious firm in Paris.

**Physical Appearance:** Ren stands at 5'10" with an athletic build and short, dark hair that often falls across his forehead. His bright brown eyes are almond-shaped and express a deep intensity. He has a small scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident and a charming smile that can disarm even the toughest of people.

**Occupation:** Ren is a rising star in the engineering world, known for his innovative designs and ability to think outside the box. He works as a lead engineer at a top firm in Paris, where he oversees projects worth millions of euros.

**Personality:** Ren is a complex individual with a dark past. He has always struggled with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, stemming from his childhood experiences with poverty and neglect. However, these challenges have driven him to become one of the most sought-after engineers in his field. Ren is fiercely ambitious, willing to do whatever it takes to succeed, including sacrificing relationships and personal well-being.

**Daily Life:** Ren's days are filled with long hours at the office, where he works tirelessly to meet project deadlines and impress his superiors. He spends much of his free time networking, attending industry events, and reading about the latest advancements in engineering. Despite his success, Ren struggles to form meaningful connections with others, fearing that he will lose his edge or be seen as vulnerable.

**Quirks:** Ren has a habit of tapping his pen on his desk when he's deep in thought, and he often finds himself lost in daydreams about the past. He is also an avid collector of antique clocks and watches, which he sees as a symbol of precision and control.

**Goals:** Ren's ultimate goal is to become one of the top engineers in his field, earning recognition and respect from his peers. However, beneath this surface-level ambition lies a deeper desire for validation and acceptance – proof that he has truly overcome his troubled past and earned his place among the elite.
