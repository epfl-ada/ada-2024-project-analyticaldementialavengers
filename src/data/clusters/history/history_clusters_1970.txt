In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundam entalism, as the Shi'a theocracy ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy andgodless communism.People were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian societyin cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical social structure .The Green Revolution  of the late 1960s brought about self-suf ficiency in food in many developing economies.
Atthe same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life.
This consequentlysaw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social communities amid increasing information blockadeacross social class.Another common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for womenin industrialized societies.
More women could enter the workforce.
However , the gender role of men remained asthat of a breadwinner .
The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of womenentering the non-agrarian economic workforce.
The Iranian revolution  also affected global attitudes toward andamong those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.The global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global zeitgeist  revealed theinterdependence of economies since World War II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States andthe Soviet Union.Prominent assassinations, tar geted killings, and assassination attempts include:Assassinations and attemptsAldo MoroPark ChungHeeDate DescriptionJune 1, 1970Pedro Eugenio Aramburu.

[17]The 1970s were perhaps the worst decade of most industrialized countries' economic performance since the GreatDepression .
[18] Although there was no severe economic depression  as witnes sed in the 1930s, economic growthrates were considerably lower than previous decades.
As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from theprosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973.
The oil shocks of 1973 and 1979  adde d to the existing ailmentsand conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade.
U.S. manufacturing industriesbegan to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus (as of 2009 ) in 1975.
In contra st,Japan and West Germany experienced  economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leadingmanufacturers.
In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-lar gest economy .
[3] Japanwould rank as the world's second-lar gest economy until 1994 when the European Economic  Area  (18 coun triesunder a single market) came into ef fect.In the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approx imately 2.5%.
From 1970 to 1979,however , the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.
[19] This period is also knownfor "stagflation ", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased.
It led to double-digitinterest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year).
The prime  rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, thehighest in history .
[18] A rising cost of housing was reflected in the average price of a new home in the U.S. Theaverage price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980.
By the time of 1980, whenU.S.
Presi dent Jimmy Carter was running for re-election  against Ronald Reagan , the misery index (the sum of theunemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.
[20] The economic problems of the1970s would result in a sluggish cynicis m replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust ofgovernment and technology .
Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate,as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election.
There was also the 1973–74stock market crash .EconomyLine at a gas station in Maryland,June 15, 1979.Great Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries provedunable to compete with Japanese and German wares.
Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almostparalyze the country's infrastructure.
Following the Winter of Discontent , Margaret Thatcher was elected primeminister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.In Eastern Europe, Soviet-style comma nd economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes werepersistently dogged by setbacks.
The oil shock increased East European, particu larly Soviet, exports, but a growinginability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the COMECON  block, and agrowing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.On the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especiallyby the Four Asian  Tigers  (Hong Kong, South  Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan),resulted in rapid economic transform ation and industrialization.
Theirabundance of cheap labor , combined with educational and other policyreforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970sand beyond.Economically , the 1970s were marked by the energy crisis  whic h peaked in1973 and 1979 (see 1973 oil crisis  and 1979 oil crisis ).
After the first oilshock in 1973, gasoline was rationed in many countries.
Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil;the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves.
Many European countries introducedcar-free days and weekends.
In the Unite d States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were onlyallowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbere d days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline oneven-numbered days.
The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was notsustainable  without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progr ess that had existed sincethe 19th century .
As a result, ecological awareness  rose substantially , which had a major ef fect on the economy .The 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of theintegrated circuit , and the laser.
Stephen Hawking  developed his theor ies of black holes  and the boundary-c onditionof the universe at this period with his theory called Hawking radiation .
The biological sciences greatly advanced,with molecular biology , bacteriology , virology , and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade.Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and Stephen Jay Gould 's theory of punctuatedequilibrium  revolutionized evolutionary thought.As the 1960s ended,  the United States had made two successful crewed lunar landings .
Many Americans lost interestafterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President John F. Kennedy 's goal of landing on the Moonby the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions.
There was also a growing sentiment that the billionsof dollars spent on the space program  should be put to other uses.
The Moon  landings continued through 1972, butthe near loss of the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 served to further anti-NASA  feelings.
Plans for missions up toApollo 20 were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and Saturn  hardware was used for the Skylab  space stationprogram in 1973–1974, and for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project  (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975.
Many ofthe ambitious projects NASA  had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead itwould devote most of the decade to the development of the Space Shuttle .
ASTP was the last crewed AmericanOil crisisScience and technologyScienceSpace explorationspace fligh t for the next five years.
The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia.
NASAhad planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late tosave it.Meanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972.
Bythen, however , they had already begun Salyut , the world 's first space station  program, which began in 1971.
Thiswould have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the Soyuz 11 crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of theSoyuz 18a crew during launch in April 1975.
It eventually proved a success, with missio ns as long as six monthsbeing conducted by the end of the decade.In terms of uncrewed missions, a variety of lunar and planetary probes  were  launched by the US and Sovietprograms during the decade.
The most successful of these include the Soviet Lunokhod  program, a series of roboticlunar missions which included the first uncrewed sample return  from  another world, and the American Voyagers ,which took advantage of a rare alignm ent of the outer planets to visit all of them except Pluto  by the end of the1980s.China entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first satellite , but technological backwardness andlimited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration.
Japan launched asatellite for the first time in 1972.
The European Space Agency  was founded during the decade as well.Apollo 17 Astronaut GeneCernan becomes the last manon the Moon, December 13,1972 An artist impression of anAmerican Apollo spacecraft andSoviet Soyuz spacecraftdocking, a propaganda portraitfor the Apollo–Soyuz TestProject mission America's first space stationSkylab in orbit February 8, 1974Viking 1, the first of twospacecraft sent to Mars, takesthis picture of the landing site inChryse Planitia (1978) Voyager 1 passing by Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot February 25,1979The second generation of face lifts  were first attempted in the 1970s, popularizing the procedure formillions.The first MRI image was published in 1973.BiologyConcorde landing at Farnborough inSeptember 1974César Milstein and Georges Köhler reported their discovery of how to use hybridoma cells to isolatemonoclonal antibodies , effectively beginning the history of monoclonal antibody use in science.Carl W oese  and George E.

The trains consisted of British Rail Class 43 diesel-electric locomotives at either end with British Rail Mark 3 carriages.
The trains were built in the United Kingdom byBritish Rail Engineering Limited .
The high speed trains ran at 125 miles per hour (201 km/h) speeding up journ eysbetween towns and cities and is still known as the InterCity 125 .Amtrak  was formed in the United States in 1971, assuming responsibility for inter-city passenger operationsthroughout the country .

The 1973 oil crisis  caused a move towardssmaller , fuel-ef ficien t vehicles.
Attempts were made to produce electric cars,but they were largely unsuccessful.
In the United States, imported carsbecame a significan t factor for the first time, and several domestic-builtsubcompact models  entered the market.
American-made cars such as the"quirky" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean  shaped AMC Pacer, and PontiacFirebird 's powerful Trans Am "sum up" the decade.
[22] Muscle cars andconvertible  models faded from favor during the early-1970s.
It was believedthat the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado  would be the last American-builtconvertible; ending  the open body style that once dominated the autoindustry .
[23]Cars in the U.S. from the early 1970s are noted more for their power thantheir styling, but they even lost their power by Malaise era of the late-1970s.
[24][25] Styling on America n cars became progressively more boxy andrectilinear during the 1970s,[26] with coupes  being the most popular bodystyle.
Wood paneling and shag carpets dominated the interiors.
Manyautomobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brandsand autom akers, as well as featuring "luxury" enhancements such as vinylroofs  and opera windows .
[24] Only a few had "real personalities" such as theAMC Gremlin, which was America's first modern subcompact , and the AMCPacer .
[24] "These two cars embody a sense of artful desperation that madethem stand out from  the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst ofthe seventies.
"[24]Automobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors  managed todownsize  its full-size models to more manageab le dimensions.
Ford  followed suit two years later, with Chrysleroffering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused byvarious factors.
By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy , and under its new president Lee Iacocca  (who had beenfired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout.
American Motors  beat out the U.S. Big Three  tosubcompact sized model (the Gremlin ) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into apartnership with the French automaker Renault  in 1979.European car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to theneed for performance with high fuel efficiency —designs such as theVolkswagen Golf and Passa t, BMW  3, 5, and 7 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class  appeared at the latter half of the decade.
Ford Europe, specifically FordGermany , also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company .
Thedesigns of Giorgetto Giugiaro  became dominant, along with those ofMarcello Gandini in Italy.
The 1970s also saw the decline and practicalfailure of the British car industry—a combination of militant strikes and poorquality control effectively halted development at British Leyland , owner ofall other British car companies during the 1970s.The Japanese automobile industry  flourished  during the 1970s, compared  to other major auto markets.
Japanesevehicles became internationally renown ed for their affordability , reliability , and fuel-ef ficiency , which was veryimportant to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973.
Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerizedrobotic manufacturing techniques and lean manufacturing , contributing to high-ef ficiency and low production costs.The Honda Civic was intro duced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-ef ficiency .
By 1975 Toyota  overtookHonda Civic sold well throughoutthe decade.Isabel Perón becomes thefirst woman President ofArgentina in 1974 and thefirst woman non-monarchhead of state in theWestern hemisphere.Margaret Thatcher shortlybefore becoming the UnitedKingdom's first womanPrime Minister in 1979.Thatcher's political andeconomic agenda beganthe first governmentcommitted to neoliberalism.Volkswagen  as the top-selling imported automobile brand in the U.S., withover a million cars sold per year by this point.
[27] Other popular compact carsincluded the Toyota Corolla  and the Datsun Sunny , in addition to other carsfrom those companies and others such as Subaru , Mitsubishi , and Mazda .The role of women in society was profo undlyaltered with growing feminism  across the world andwith the presence and rise of a significa nt number ofwomen as heads of state outside monarchies andheads of government in a number of countries acrossthe world during the 1970s, many being the firstwomen to hold such positions.
Non-monarch womenheads of state and heads of government in this periodincluded Isabel Perón  as the first woman President inArgentina and the first woman non-monarch head ofstate in the Western hemisphere  in 1974 until beingdeposed in 1976, Elisabeth Domitien  beco mes thefirst woman Prime Minister of the Central AfricanRepublic, Indira Gandhi continuing as Prime  Ministerof India until 1977 (and taking office again in 1980),Sirimavo Bandarana ike, Prim e minister of Sri Lanka(Former Ceylon ) and first female head of government in the world, re-elected in1970, Prim e Ministe r Golda Meir of Israel and acting  chairman Soong Ching-ling  ofthe People's Republic of China continu ing their leadership from the sixties, LidiaGueiler Tejada becoming  the interim President of Bolivia beginning from 1979 to1980, Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo  becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and MargaretThatcher  becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979.
Both Indira Gandhi andMargaret Thatcher would remain important political figures in the following decade in the 1980s.Pope Paul VI recog nized the popularity of Catholic  feminists, but ultim ately held to tradition when it came toleaving bishops, priests, and deacons a male-only position.
[28]The opposition to the War in Vietnam  that began in the 1960s grew exponentially during the early 1970s.
One of thebest-known anti-war demonstrations was the Kent State shootings .
In 1970, university students were protesting thewar and the draft.
Riots ensued during the weekend and the National Guard was called in to maintain the peace.However , by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting.Four students were killed and nine were injured.
This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country andbecame a staple of anti-V ietnam demonstrations.SocietyRole of women in societySocial movementsAnti-war protestsEnvironmentalismAnti-war protest against the VietnamWar in Washington, D.C., on April24, 1971.A Women's Liberation march inWashington, D.C., 1970The 1970s  started a mainstream affirmat ion of the environmental issues  earlyactivists from the 1960s, such as Rachel Carson  and Murray Bookchin , hadwarned of.
The Apollo 11 mission, which had occurred at the end of theprevious decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as anintegrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness topreserve nature.
On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first EarthDay, in which  over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly tenthousand primary and secondary schools participated.The 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existingsocial taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasin gly accepted in the Western world.The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor .
Western Europewas in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United State s, as nudity in film and on TV hadbeen gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countr ies during this time began allowingwomen to go topless  in public places.
Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany andScandinavia.
Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws inthe 1980s to 1990s.The market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomerpopulation, and the 1972 movie Behind the Green Door, an X-rated feature,  became one of the top-grossing films ofthe year.
Playboy Magazine  appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themedmagazines such as Penthouse Magazine  and Hustler Magazine .By the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of theAIDS epidemic  helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution.
Adult movie theaters, which had exploded innumbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of urban decay  in the US, declined as pornographicmovies would lar gely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.Crime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to acomplex of social, economic, and demographic factors.
By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a seriouscause of concern, New York City being particularly affected.
In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capitalpunishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later .The Second-W ave Feminist Movement in the United States, which hadbegun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent rolewithin society.
The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the NineteenthAmendment to the United States Constitution  (which legalized femalesuffrage ) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equalityand other protests.1971 saw Erin Pizzey  establish the world's first domestic violence shelter inChiswick , London and Pizze y and her colleagues opened further facilitiesthroughout the next few years.
This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse inother countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in Amsterdam  in 1974.
[29][30]Sexual revolutionCrime and urban decayFeminismWith the anthology Sister hood is Powerful  and other works, such as Sexual Politics , being published at the start ofthe decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before.
In addition, the Supreme Court 's 1973decision of Roe v. Wade, which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movementinto the national political spotlight.Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan , Betty Ford , Shirley Chisholm , Bella Abzug , Robin Morgan, Kate Millett  andElizabeth Holtzman , among many others, led the movement for women's equality .Even musically , the women's movement  had its shining moment.
Australian-American singer Helen Reddy , recordedthe song "I Am Woman ", which became an anthem for the women's liberation movement .
"I Am Woman" reachedNo.
1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.Another movement to arise was the 1970s Goddess movement , which took place to combat patriarchal ideas ofreligion.
[31][32]Most efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws,were successful.
Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gainedunheard of success in business, politics, education, science, the law, and even the home .
Although most aims of themovement were successful, however , there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify theEqual Rights Amen dment  to the U.S. Cons titution  with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratifyERA  in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs).
Also, the wagegap failed to close, but it did become smaller .The second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982  with the failure of the Equal RightsAmendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C.. American women created a brief, butpowerful, third-wave  in the early 1990s which addressed sexual harassment  (inspired by the Anita Hill–ClarenceThomas  Senate Judiciary Committee  hearings of 1991).
The results of the movement included a new awareness ofsuch issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, particularly the UnitedStates Senate .The Civil Rights Movement  of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselvesmore by their differences than by their universalities.
The Black Nationalist  movement grew out of frustrations withthe "non-v iolent" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists.
With the April 1968 assassination of Martin LutherKing Jr. and June 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy , many Black peopl e were compelled to reject ideas ofnegotiation and instead embrace isolation.
The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for CivilRights in the 1970s.
The seventies were seen as the "woman's turn", though many feminists incorporated civil rightsideals into their movement.
A feminist who had inherited the leadership positio n of the civil rights movement fromher husband, Coretta Scott King , as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helpingand encou raging the Woman's Liberation  movemen t, and other movements as well.
At the National Women'sConference  in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality inthe movem ent's goals.
Similarly , the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election ofpolitical figures such as Harvey Milk to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislationpassed and not passed during the decade.
Many celebrities, including Freddie Mercury  and Andy Warhol , also"came out " during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.Civil rightsYouth suffrageThe Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution  was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the votingage for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years.
The primary impetus for this change was the factthat young men were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War before they were old enough to vote.
[33]The first and secondgenerations of video gameconsoles like the MagnavoxOdyssey and Atari 2600(pictured) were hits in the1970s.

Pong, created by Atari Inc. in1972, is one of the earliestarcade video games and wasthe first electronic sports videogame.
Other games likeBreakout, Galaxian, Asteroidsand Space Invaders also helpeddefine the decade in gamingculture.
Four Olympic Games were heldin the 1970s, Sapporo andMunich in 1972, Innsbruck andMontreal in 1976 (all during theCold War, and promptingsignificant events like theMunich massacre in 1972 andthe African-led boycott in 1976).New Hollywood films like Jaws,Star Wars, The Godfather, TheExorcist, Grease, and Rocky aswell as Superman, SaturdayNight Fever, One Flew Over theCuckoo's Nest, and Willy Wonkaand the Chocolate Factory wereall extremely popular during the1970s and decades following.
