Goode " (1958), refined and developed the majo r elements that made rock and roll distinctive,focusing on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship  that woul d be a major influence on subsequentrock musi c.[18] Bill Haley , Presley , Jerry Lee Lewis , The Everl y Brothers , Carl Perki ns, Johnny Cash, ConwayTwitty , Johnny Horton, and Marty Robbins were Rockabilly  musicians .

The tragedy is later termed "The Day the Music Died ",popularized in Don McLean 's 1971 song "American Pie".
This event, combined with the conscription of Presley intothe US Army , is often taken to mark the point where the era of 1950s rock-and-roll ended.The 1950s are known as the Golden Age of Television  by some people.
