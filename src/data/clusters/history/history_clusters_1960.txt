Fires had erupted on the river many times,including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, whichdescribed the Cuyahoga as the river that "oozes rather than flows" and in which a person"does not drown but decays."
This helped spur legislative action on water pollution controlresulting in the Clean W ater Act, Great Lakes W ater Quality Agreement, and the creation ofthe federal Environmental Protection Agency .1969 – Hurricane Camille  hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status.
It peaked and madelandfall with 175 mph (280 km/h) winds and caused $1.42 billion (1969 USD) in damages.Non-natural:On 16 December 1960, a United Airlines  DC-8 and a Trans W orld Airlines  LockheedConstellation collided over New York City  and crashed, killing 134 people.On 15 February 1961, Sabena Flight 548  crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground.

A total of 155 people died in the crash.In the second half of the decade, young  people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the oldtime, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level ofmaterialism which was so common during the era.
This created a "countercult ure" that sparked a socialrevolution througho ut much of the Western world.
It began in the United States as a reaction against theconservatism and social conformity  of the 1950s, and the U.S. govern ment's extensive militaryintervention in Vietnam.
The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement becameknown as hippies .
These groups created a movement toward liberation in society , including the sexualrevolution , questioning authority and government , and demanding more freedoms and rights for womenSocial and political movementsCounterculture and social revolutionA demonstrator offers a flower tomilitary police guarding thePentagon during the NationalMobilization Committee to End theWar in Vietnam's 21 October 1967March on the PentagonLeaders of the civil rights movement's28 August 1963, March on Washingtonin front of the statue of Abraham Lincolnand minorities.
The Under ground Press , a widesp read, eclectic collection of newspapers served as aunifying medium for the counterculture.
The movement was also marked by the first widespread, sociallyaccepted drug use (including LSD  and marijuana ) and psychedelic  music.The war in Vietnam  would eventually lead to a commitment ofover half a million  American troops, resulting in over 58,500American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement inthe United States.
As late as the end of 1965, few Americansprotested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the wardragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrestescalated.
Students became a powerful and disruptive force anduniversity campuses sparked a national debate over the war.
As themovement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts aboutthe war also began to appear within the administration itself.
Amass movement began rising in oppos ition to the Vietnam War,including the National Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam 's1967 march to the United Nations and its March on the Pentagon ,the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests  at which theslogan "The whole world is watching " became famous, andcontinuing in the massive Moratorium  protests in 1969 as well asthe movem ent of resistance to conscription  ("the Draft") for thewar.The antiwar movement  was initially based on the older 1950s Peace movement , heavily influenced by theAmerican Commun ist Party , but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based massmovement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was calle d a "sit-in ".
Other termsheard in the United States included "the Draft ", "draft dodger ", "conscientious objector ", and "Vietnamvet".
Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: "If you're old enough to die for your country , you'reold enough to vote.
"Beginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s,African Americans  in the United States organized a movementto end legalized racial discrimination  and obtain voting rights .This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955and 1968, particularly in the South.
The emer gence of theBlack Power movement , which lasted roughly from 1966 to1975, enlar ged the aims of the civil rights movement to includeracial dignity , economic  and political  self-suf ficiency , and anti-imperialism .The movement was characterized by major campaigns of civilresistance .
Between 1955 and 1968, acts of civil disobedienceand nonviolent  protest produced crisis situations betweenAnti-war movementCivil rights movementactivists and government authorities.
Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communitiesoften had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by AfricanAmericans.
Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successfulMontgomery bus boycott  (1955–1956) in Alabama, sit-ins  such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins(1960) in North Carolina, marches  such as the Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama , andother nonviolent activities.Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of CivilRights Act of 1964[43] that bann ed discrim ination based on "race, color , religion, or national origin" inemployment practic es and public accommodations, the Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored andprotected voting rights, the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965  that dram atically openedentry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.Another large ethnic minority group, the Mexican-Americans , are among other Hispanics  in the U.S. whofought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity .
The largest Mexican-Americanpopulations were in the Southwestern United States, such as California with over 1 million Chicanos  inLos Ange les alone, and Texas where Jim Crow  laws included Mexican-Americans as "non-white" insome instances to be legally segregated.Socially , the Chicano Movement  addressed what it perceived to be negative ethnic stereotypes  ofMexicans in mass media and the American consciousness.
It did so through the creation of works ofliterary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture .
Chicanos fought to endsocial stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official bilingualism  in federaland state governments.The Chicano Movement also addressed  discrimination in public and private institutions.
Early in thetwentieth century , Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination.One of those organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens , was formed in 1929 andremains active today .
[44]The move ment gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the American G.I.
Foru m,which was formed by returning Mexic an American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rightsorganizations.
[45]Mexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 Mendezv.
Westminster  U.S. Supreme Court  rulin g which decla red that segregating children of "Mexican andLatin descent" was unconstitutional and the 1954 Hernandez v. Texas ruling which declar ed that MexicanAmericans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the 14thAmendment  of the U.S. Constitution .
[46][47]The most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community , the MexicanAmerican Legal Defense and Education al Fund  (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.
[48] Although modeledafter the NAACP  Legal Defense and Educational Fund , MALDEF has also taken on many of thefunctions of other or ganizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.Hispanic and Chicano movementMeanwhile, Puerto Ricans  in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality andsocioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states.
The mainconcentration of the population was in New York City .In the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music,foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream.
Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country ,especially in U.S.–Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of theCuban American  community in Miami, Florida.The multi tude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960swas upheld as a world and industry leader.
The issues of civil rights and warfar e became major points ofreflection of virtue and democracy , what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was nowbecoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.
A document known as the Port HuronStatement exemplifi es these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, "while these and otherproblems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjectiveconcerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America.
Thedeclaration "all men are created equal... " rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and thebig cities of the North.
The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economicand milita ry investments in the Cold War status quo."
These intolerable issues became too visible toignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly , the realization that we as individuals take theresponsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emer ging idealism of the 1960s.A second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early1960s.
While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning dejure inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and de factoinequalities associated with women.
At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in thehome, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions.
In the U.S., a Presidential Commissionon the Status of Women  found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect oflife, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the EqualPay Act of 1963 , Title IX, etc.)
which broke down the last remai ning legal barriers to women's personalfreedom and professional success.Feminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social andpolitical views that limited women.
In 1963, with Betty Friedan 's book, The Feminine Mystique , the roleof women in society , and in public and private life was questioned.
By 1966, the movement wasbeginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along withother feminists, founded the National Organization for Women .
In 1968, "Women's Liberation " became ahousehold term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the civil right s movementwhen New York Radical Women , led by Robin Morgan, protested the annual Miss America pageant inAtlantic City, New Jersey .
The movement continued throughout the next decades.
Gloria Steinem  was akey feminist.Second-wave feminismGay rights movementThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT  rights in the late 1960s andearly 1970 s. Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneershad begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.
These groups were rather conservative in their practices,emphasizing that gay men and women are no differ ent from those who are straight  and deserve fullequality .
This philos ophy would be dominant again after AIDS, but by the very end of the 1960s, themovement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, andencouraging gay pride .The symb olic birth of the gay rights  movement  would not come until the decade had almost come to aclose.
Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.
Gay establishments such as the Stonewall Inn in NewYork City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.
On a night in late June 1969, LGBTpeople resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.
This uprising called theStonewall riots began a new period of the LGBT  rights movement that in the next decade would causedramatic change both inside the LGBT  community and in the mainstream American culture.The rapid rise of a "New Left" applied the class perspective of Marxism  to postwa r America but had littleorganizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the Communist Party , and even wentas far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movem ent.
Sympathetic to theideology of C. Wright Mills , the New Left differed from the traditio nal left in its resistance to dogma andits emphasis on personal as well as societal change.
Students for a Democratic Society  (SDS) became theorganizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War inVietnam.
The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based Trotskyist , Maoist  and anarchistgroups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to militancy .The 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types.
Between 1960and 1969 reported incidence of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled andhave yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.
[49] Large riots broke out in many cities like Chicago,Detroit, Los Angeles , New York City, Newark, New Jersey , Oakland, California  and Washington, D.C. Bythe end of the decade, politicians like Geor ge Wallace  and Richard Nixon  campaigned on restoring lawand order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.The Space Race  between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s.
The Soviets sentthe first man, Yuri Gagarin , into outer space  during the Vostok 1 mission on 12 April 1961, and scored ahost of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking  the lead.

In 1965, Sovietslaunched the first probe to hit another planet of the SolarSystem  (Venus), Venera 3, and the first probe to make a softlanding on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, Luna9.
In March 1966, the Soviet Union launc hed Luna 10, whichbecame the first space probe  to enter orbit aroun d the Moon,and in September 1968, Zond 5 flew the first terrestrialbeings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.The deaths of astron auts Gus Grissom , Ed White , and RogerB.
Chaf fee in the Apollo 1 fire on 27 January  1967, put atemporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterwardprogress was steady , with the Apollo 8 crew (Frank Borman,Jim Lovell , William Anders ) being the first crewed mission toorbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of1968.On 20 July 1969, the first humans landed on the Moon .
TheApollo 11 mission, launched on 16 July 1969, carried missionCommander Neil Armstrong , Command Module PilotMichael Collins , and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin , andAldrin and Armstro ng flew the Lunar Module Eagle  to thelunar surface.
Apollo 11 fulfilled President John F. Kennedy 'sgoal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which hehad expres sed during a speech given before a joint session ofCongress on 25 May 1961: "I believe that this nation shouldcommit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out,of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to theEarth.
"The Sovie t program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer Sergey Korolyov  in 1966.Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by aninadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.
Shortly after the AmericanApollo 1 disaster , tragedy struck the Soviet program when cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov  was killedwhen the parachutes on his Soyuz 1  flight failed.A succession of uncrewed American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, Venus, and Mars  during the1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.1960 – The female birth-control contraceptive, the pill , was released in the United Statesafter Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) approval.1963 – The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDAOther scientific developmentsThe birth control pill wasintroduced in 1960.A 0 series Shinkansen high-speedrail set in Tokyo, May 19671964 – The discovery and confirmation of the Cosmicmicrowave background  in 1964 secured the Big Bang asthe best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.1965 – AstroT urf introduced.1967 – First heart transplantation  operation by ProfessorChristiaan Barnard  in South Africa.1967 – Discovery of the first known pulsar  (a rapidlyspinning neutron star ).During the late 1960s, the Green Revolution  achieved amajor leap in agricultural production, mitigating a potentialfamine situation.

The horsepower race reached its climax inthe late 1960s, with muscle cars sold by most makes.
The compactFord Mustang , launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatestsuccesses.
The "Big Three " American automakers enjoyed theirhighest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of Studebaker  in 1966 left AmericanMotors Corporation  as the last significant independent.
The decade would see the car market split intodifferent size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included compact  and mid-sized  cars inaddition to full-sized  ones.The popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configu ration, was born in 1965with the introductio n of the Renault 16, many of this car's design principles live on in its moderncounterparts: a large rear opening incorp orating the rear window , foldable rear seats to extend boot space.The Mini , released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, buttechnically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.Japanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such asthe Toyota Corolla , Datsun 510, and the first popular Japanese sports car, the Datsun 240Z , were releasedin the mid- to late-1960s.Mopeds and Scooters gains popularity in these decade, with Honda Super Cub in United States, Japanand Europe, Mitsubishi Silver Pigeon  in Japan and Vespa, Kreidler Florett ,Zundapp  and Sachs  mopeds inWestern Europe.1960 – The first working laser was demonstrated in May by Theodore Maiman  at HughesResearch Laboratories .TechnologyAutomobiles and MotorcyclesElectronics and communicationsExamples of 1960s technology,including two rotary-dial telephonesand a Kodak camera.1960 – Tony Hoare  announces the Quicksort  algorithm ,the most common sorter on computers.1961 – Unimate , the first industrial robot , wasintroduced.1962 – First transatlantic satellite broadcast via theTelstar  satellite.1962 – The first computer video game, Spacewar!

In1969, humans landed on theMoon for the first time.
The superhero boom of thedecade saw in media andpopular culture, TV series likeBatman, The Green Hornet, TheMarvel Super Heroes, andSpider-Man were more popular.The counterculture movement  dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments beingthe Summer of Love  in San Francisco in 1967, and the Woodstock Festival  in upstate New York in 1969.Psychedelic drugs , especially LSD , were widely used medicinally , spiritually and recreationallythroughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by Timothy Leary  with his slogan "Turn on, tune in,The Miracles pictured in 1962.Known as Motown's "soulsupergroup", The Miracles were oneof the first commercially successfulacts of the 1960s and propelled bothMotown and its Tamla label tointernational fame.drop out".
Ken Kesey  and the Merry Pranksters  also played a part in the role of "turning heads on".Psychedelic  influ enced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musiciansdied of drug overdoses (see 27 Club ).
There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy ,and many attempts were made to found  communes, which varied from supporting free love to religiouspuritanism.The rock 'n' roll movement of the 1950s  quickly came to an end in1959 with the Day the Music Died  (as explained in the song"American Pie"), the scandal of Jerry Lee Lewis ' marriage  to his13-year -old cousin, and the induction of Elvis Presley  into theUnited States Army .
As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' rollstars of the '50s such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard haddropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to bedominated by girl groups, surf music , novelty pop songs,  clean-cutteen idols, and Motown  music.
Another important change in musicduring the early 1960s was the American folk music revival  whichintroduced Bob Dylan , Joan Baez , Pete Seege r, The Kings ton Trio,Harry Belafonte , Odetta , Phil Ochs , and many other singer -songwriters to the public.Girl groups and female singers, such as the Shirelles , BettyEverett , Little Eva, the Dixie Cups , the Ronettes , Martha and theVandellas  and the Supremes  dominated the charts in the early1960s.
This style consisted typically of light pop themes aboutteenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and astrong rhythm.
Most girl groups were African-American, but whitegirl groups and singers, such as Lesley Gore , the Angels , and the Shangri-Las  also emer ged during thisperiod.Around the same time, record producer Phil Spector  began producing girl groups and created a new kindof pop music produ ction that came to be known as the Wall of Sound .
This style emphas ized higherbudgets and more elaborate arrangemen ts, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple,light-hearted pop sound.
Spector's innov ations became integral to the growing sophistication of popularmusic from 1965 onward.Also during the early 1960s, surf rock emer ged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern Californiaand based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance andinnocent fun.
The Beach Boys  quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely andsingle-handedly overshadowed the many lesser -known artists in the subgenre.
Surf rock reached its peakin 1963–1965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the British Invasion  and thecounterculture movement.The car song also emer ged as a rock subgenre in the early 1960s, which focused on teenagers' fascinationwith car culture .
The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo Jan and Dean .
Suchnotable songs include "Little Deuce Coupe ", "409", and "Shut Down ", all by the Beach Boys; Jan andMusicThe arrival of the Beatles inthe U.S. during 1964, andparticularly their appearanceon television's The EdSullivan Show, marked thebeginning of the BritishInvasion in the history ofmusic, in which a largenumber of rock and popmusic acts from the UnitedKingdom gained enormouspopularity in the U.S.Bob Dylan was the face ofthe American folk musicrevival of the 1960s.
In1964, Dylan was shiftinghis focus to more abstractand introspective themes,and eventually wouldadapt the use of electricinstrumentation, alienatingmany in the folk crowd.
"The 60s were a leap inhuman consciousness.Mahatma Gandhi , MalcolmX, Martin Luther King , CheGuevara , Mother Teresa ,they led a revolution ofconscience.
The Beatles ,The Doors , Jimi Hendrixcreated revolution andevolution themes.
Themusic was like Dalí, withmany colors andrevolutionary ways.
Theyouth of today must gothere to find themselves.
"– Carlos Santana[51]Dean 's "Little Old Lady from Pasadena " and"Drag City", Ronny and the Daytonas ' "LittleGTO", and many others.
Like girl groups andsurf rock, car songs also becameovershadowed by the British Invasion and thecounterculture movement.The early 1960s also saw the golden age ofanother rock subgen re, the teen tragedy song ,which focused on lost teen romance causedby sudden  death, mainly in traffic accidents .Such songs included Mark Dinning 's "TeenAngel ", Ray Peterson 's "Tell Laura I LoveHer", Jan and Dean 's "Dead Man's Curve ",the Shang ri-Las ' "Leader of the Pack ", andperhaps the subgenre's most popular , "LastKiss" by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers .In the early 1960s, Britain became a hotbed ofrock 'n' roll activity during this time.
In late1963, the Beatles embarked on their first UStour and cult singer Dusty Springfieldreleased her first solo single.
A few monthslater, rock 'n' roll founding father Chuck Berry emer ged from a 21⁄2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring.
The stage was setfor the spectacular revival of rock music.In the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll – as well as doowop, girl-group songs, show tunes – and wore leather jackets.
Theirmanager Brian Epstein  encouraged the group to wear suits.Beatlemania  abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on The EdSullivan Show in 1964.
Late in 1965, the Beatles released the albumRubber Soul which marked the beginning of their transition to asophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements andproduction, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focusonly on albums.
A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including group s like the Rolling Stones , theWho  and the Kinks  who would become legends in their own right.As the counterculture movement developed, artists began making newkinds of music influ enced by the use of psychedelic drugs.
GuitaristJimi Hendrix  emer ged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically newapproach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry , previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar .Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic popthemes.A major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the moveme nt away from singles andtowards albums.
Previously , popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier , the 78 single)and album s such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks,instrumentals, and covers.
The developm ent of the AOR (album-oriented rock)  format was complicatedand involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by BobDylan of "serious" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach.
In any case, after1965 the vinyl LP  had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.Blues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to theyoung white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other stylessuch as soul and funk.Jazz music and pop standards  during the first half of the 1960s was largely a continuation of 1950s styles,retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites.
By 1967, the death of severalimportant jazz figures such as John Coltrane  and Nat King Cole  precipitated a decline in the genre.
Thetakeover of rock in the late 1960s largely spelled the end of jazz and standards as mainstream forms ofmusic, after they had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century .Country music gained popularity on the West Coas t, due in large part to the Bakersfield sound , led byBuck Owens  and Merle Haggard .
