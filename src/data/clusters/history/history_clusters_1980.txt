But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers,caused a tremendous crash  in late 1983.
For the next three years, the video game market practicallyceased to exist in the US.
But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by Nintendo , whoseFamicom console and mascot Mario  had been enjoying  considerable success in Japan since 1983.Renamed the Nintendo Entertainm ent System  (NES), it would claim 90% of the American video gamemarket by 1989.

Consumer VCRs  and video rental stores became commonplace as VHS  won out over thecompeting Betamax  standard.
In addition, in the early 1980 s various companies began selling compact,modestly priced synthesizers  to the public.

The Smartmodem paved theway for the modern  modems that exist today , mainly because it was the first modem to transform whathad previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage.
The Smartmodemcontributed to the rise in popularity of BBS  systems in the 1980 s and early 1990s, which were the mainway to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before theInternet  and the World Wide Web finally became popular in the mid-1990s.In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC8000X becomes the firstcommercially available mobilephone model Trimline telephoneDuring the decade thestandardization of Group 3facsimile terminals by theInternational TelecommunicationUnion contributed to thesignificant spread of the faxmachine.

The TCP/IP  protocol will become theInformation technologydominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as thefoundation on which the Internet  would be based.The GNU Project  (1983).
The Free Software Foundation  (1985).FidoNet  – In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling BBS users to send private messages(e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connectedto the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other .
The rise in popularity andavailability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed tothe irrelevance of FidoNet.World W ide W eb – In 1989, the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee  first proposed aproject to his employer CERN , based on the concept of hypertext , to facilitate sharing andupdating information among researchers.
In mid-November 1989 he would develop the firstsuccessful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol  (HTTP) client and servervia the internet .
In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would laterbecome the foundation of the World Wide W eb.In 1981, Microsoft introducedthe MS-DOS operating system,which would become the world'smost widely used operatingsystem in the 1980s and firsthalf of the 1990s.
The most basic CD was firstintroduced in October 1982 forthe purpose of distribution andlistening to digital audioIn 1989, the British computerscientist Tim Berners-Lee firstproposed the World Wide Web,which he would develop in thecoming yearsAmerican interplane tary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known.
Aftermaking a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980–1981.
Voyager 2 reached Uranus in1986 (just a few days before the Challenger  disas ter), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited theSolar System.Space explorationThe Space Shuttle Columbiaseconds after engine ignition, 1981No American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and theViking  probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operationsby 1982.
The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but theyfailed.The arriva l of Halley's Comet  in 1986 was met by a series ofSoviet, Japanese and European Space Agency  (ESA) probes,namely Halley Armada .After a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronautsresumed with the launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia  in April1981.
The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, withthree more orbiters entering service in 1983–1985.
But that allcame to an end with the tragic loss of the Challenger  (STS-51-L )on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, includingChrista McAulif fe, who was to have been the first teacher  in space.
In full view of the world, a faulty O-ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause itto explode, destroying the shuttle in the process.
Extensive efforts were made to improve NASA 'sincreasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer .
Flights resumed with thelaunch of Discovery  in September 1988.The Sovie t program  with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks.The Salyut 6 space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by Salyut 7 in 1982.
Then came Mir in 1986,which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Sovietspace stations that had begun in 1971.
One of the Soviet Union's last "superprojects" was the Buran  spaceshuttle ; it was only used once, in 1988.The American auto industry began in the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor qualitycontrol, rising impo rt competition, and a severe economic downturn.
[28] Chrysler  and American Motors(AMC) were near bankruptcy , and Ford  was little better off.
[29] Only General Motors  (GM) continuedwith busin ess as usual.
But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto salesin the United States hit a new record.

In 1986, Hyundai  became the first Korean automaker to enter the American market.
In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built Yugo was broug ht to the US,but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes.
It was sold up to 1991, wheneconomic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.As the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design.
In 1983, Ford  design teamsbegan to incorporate aerodynamic stylin g to decrease drag while in motion.
The Thunderbird  was one ofthe first cars to receive these design changes.
In 1985, Ford released the Taurus  with a design that wasrevolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.GM began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith 'srestructuring attemp ts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars.
An example were customers whoincreasingly purchas ed European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs .
In 1985, GM starte d Saturn  (the firstAutomobilesnew American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters.
Productionwould not begin until 1990.Chrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive K-cars  in 1981.
Under the leadership of LeeIacocca , the comp any turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans.A succession of models using this autom obile platform followed.
The most significant were the minivansin 1984.
These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade.In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lambor ghini  and Maserati .

He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company , whichclosed down in 1983.
The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the Back tothe Futur e film trilogy .The impos ition of corporate average fuel economy  (CAFE) fuel-milea ge standards in 1979 spelled theend of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles  reemer ged in the 1980s.
Turbochar gerswere widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from fuel injection  began totake over from the widely used application of carburetors  by the late 1980s.
Front-wheel drive alsobecame dominant.The 1980s marked the decline of Europ ean brands in North America by the end of the decade.

Attempts by the Communist government to preventthe rise of the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and thegovernment took place.
Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in othercommunist states to demand political reform.The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been sincethe 1920s, and figures like Donald Trump  and Michael Milken  were widely seen as symbolsof the decade.
Widespread fear of Japanese economic strength would grip the UnitedStates in the 1980s.The "Black Monday" stock market crash  on October 19, 1987, decreased the value of theDow Jones Industrial Average  by more than 22%, causing widespread secondary drops inworld markets.During the 1980s, for the first time in world history , transpacific trade (with East Asia, suchas China, and Latin America, primarily with Mexico) equaled that of transatlantic trade (withWestern Europe  or with neighboring Canada),[32] solidifying American economic power .
