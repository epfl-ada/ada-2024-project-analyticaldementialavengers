The consequencesof the war lingered well into the second  half of the decade,with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostlingspheres of influence  of the Western world and the SovietUnion , leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
To somedegree internal and external tensions in the post-war  erawere managed by new institutions, including the UnitedNations , the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system ,facilitating the post–W orld War II economic expansion ,which lasted well into the 1970s.
The conditions of thepost-war world encouraged decolonization  and theemer gence of new states and governments, with India ,Pakistan , Israel , Vietnam , and others declaringindependence, altho ugh rarely without bloodshed.
Thedecade also witne ssed the early beginnings of newtechnologies (such as computers , nuclear power , and jetpropulsion ), often first developed in tandem with the wareffort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-warera.The world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5billion over the course of the decade, with about 850million births and 600 million deaths in total.World War IIFlag map of the world from 1942, during World War IIWorld W ar II (1939–1945)Nazi Germany  invades Poland , Denmark , Norway ,Benelux , and the French Third Republic  from 1939 to1941.Soviet Union  invades Poland , Finland , occupies Latvia ,Estonia , Lithuania  and Romanian region of Bessarabiafrom 1939 to 1941.Germany faces the United Kingdom  in the Battle of Britain(1940).

European cinema  survived although obviously curtailedduring wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the UnitedKingdom , France , Italy, the Soviet Union  and elsew here in Europe.
Thecinema of Japan  also survi ved.
Akira Kurosawa  and other  directors managedto produce significant films during the 1940s.Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith (1943) about current nazi crimesin occupied Europe during the war and about lies of nazi propaganda.
[6]Film Noir, a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during thedecade.
Films such as The Maltese Falcon  and The Big Sleep  are considered class ics and helped launch the careersof legenda ry actors such as Humphrey Bogart  and Ava Gardn er.
The genre has been widely copied since its initialinception.In France during the war the tour de force Childr en of Paradise  directed by Marcel Carné (1945), was shot in Nazioccupied Paris.

Crosby wasthe leading figure of the crooner sound as well as its most iconic,defining artist.
By the 1940s, he was an entertainment superstar whomastered all of the major media formats of the day , movies, radio,and recorded music.The most popular music style during the 1940s was swing , whichprevailed during W orld W ar II.
In the later periods of the 1940s, lessswing was prominent and crooners like Frank Sinatra , along withgenres such as bebop and the earliest traces of rock and roll, werethe prevalent genre.For Whom the Bell T olls by Ernest Hemingway  in 1940.The Myth of Sisyphus  by Albert Camus  in 1942.The Stranger  by Albert Camus  in 1942.The Little Prince  by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry  in 1943.Anti-Semite and Jew  by Jean-Paul Sartre  in 1943.The Fountainhead  by Ayn Rand  in 1943.No Exit  by Jean-Paul Sartre  in 1944.Pippi Longstocking  by Astrid Lindgren  in 1945.The Diary of Anne Frank  by Anne Frank  in 1947.Death of a Salesman  by Arthur Miller  in 1949.Nineteen Eighty-Four  by George Orwell  in 1949.The Glass Menagerie  by Tennessee Williams  in 1944.Because fashion items and fabrics were rationed  due to World War II, fashionbecame more utilitarian.
Women's fashion started including suits, which werefeminized with straight knee-length skirts and accessories.
There were challe ngesimposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather , rubber , metal (for snaps,buckles, and embell ishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used inany one garment.
After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in theUnited States almost entirely , with the exception of a few trends coming fromwartorn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force .
Theidea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until theend of the war.
Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortagescontrolled import items such as silk and furs.
Floral prints dominated the early1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as"atomic prints" or geometric patterns and shapes.
In response to the war effort,patriotic nautical themes and dark green s and khakis dominating the color palettes, astrousers and wedges  slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due toMusicLiteratureFashionshortages in stockings and gasoline.
The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats,front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines weresailor , mandarin and scalloped.

The 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games  were cancelled because of World War II.
During World War II in theUnited States Heavyweight Boxing Champion  Joe Louis  and numerous stars and performers from Americanbaseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war.
Among the many baseball players(including well known stars) who served during World War II were Moe Berg, Joe DiMaggio , Bob Feller , HankGreenber g, Stan Musial  (in 1945), Warren Spahn , and Ted Williams .
They like many others sacrificed their personaland valuable career time for the benefit and well-being of the rest of society .
The Summer Olympics were resumedin 1948 in London  and the Winter games were held that year in St. Moritz , Switzerland .In 1947, Wataru Misaka  of the New York Knicks  became the first person of color to play in modern professionalbasketball, just months after Jackie Robinson  had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball  for theBrooklyn Dodgers .
[11]During the early 1940s World War II had an enormous impact on Major Leag ue Baseball as many players includingmany of the most successful stars joined the war effort.
After the war many players returned to their teams, while themajor even t of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of Jackie Robinson  to a playe rs contract by BranchRickey  the genera l manage r of the Brooklyn Dodgers .
Signing Robinson opened the door to the integration  of MajorLeague Baseball finally putting an end to the professional discrimination that had characterized the sport since the19th century .Roy CampanellaJoe DiMaggioBandsSportsBaseballJackie Robinson with theMontreal Royals in July1946Joe Louis in 1941, worldheavyweight boxingchampionBill DickeyLarry DobyBob FellerJosh GibsonHank GreenbergMonte IrvinBuck LeonardJohnny MizeStan MusialSatchel PaigeBranch RickeyJackie RobinsonTed WilliamsDuring the mid-1930s and throughout the years leading up to the 1940s Joe Louiswas an enormously popular Heavyweight boxer .
In 1936, he lost an important 12round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer Max Schmeling  and he vowed tomeet Schm eling once again in the ring.
Louis' comeback bout against Schm elingbecame an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracyagainst Nazism and Fascism.
When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmelin g outin the first few secon ds of the first round during their rematch at Yankee Stadium , hissensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation.
Louis enlisted in the U.S.Army  on January 10, 1942 , in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .
Louis'cultural impact was felt well outside the ring.
He is widely regarded as the firstAfrican American  to achieve  the status of a nationwide hero within the United States,and was also a focal  point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World WarII.
